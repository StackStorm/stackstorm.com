<p><em><strong>StackStorm joins Red Hat OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure Partner Network</strong></em></p>
<p>PALO ALTO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–<a href=http://www.stackstorm.com>StackStorm</a>, a software company leading the third wave of operations automation, today announced a collaboration with Red Hat, Inc., the world’s leading provider of open source solutions. StackStorm and Red Hat will work together to provide interoperability of their solutions as part of the Red Hat OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure Partner Network.</p>
<p>“We’re pleased to have StackStorm join us in the Red Hat OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure Partner Network,” said Mike Werner, senior director, Global Ecosystems, Red Hat. “To help customers get the most out of Red Hat’s OpenStack offerings and our open hybrid cloud solutions, we work closely with technology companies like StackStorm that provide powerful and complementary solutions. We look forward to continued collaboration with StackStorm as a key member of Red Hat’s OpenStack ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform is a highly scalable Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) product that delivers an open, flexible and enterprise-ready private cloud foundation, built on OpenStack and integrated with and optimized for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. StackStorm delivers automation that safely ties together loosely coupled, heterogeneous, ever changing cloud infrastructures including private and public clouds. StackStorm’s foundation has been in OpenStack, where it is a leading contributor for Project Mistral, the OpenStack workflow-as-a-service project.</p>
<p>“The work done through this collaboration gives our customers the confidence that StackStorm and Red Hat OpenStack have been thoroughly tested and are validated as interoperable,” said Evan Powell, CEO, StackStorm. “As we approach broad availability of our software, building partnerships with industry leaders such as Red Hat is crucial. We look forward to working closely together with Red Hat.”</p>
<p>The Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure Partner Network connects both business and technical resources to third-party technology companies who are aligning with Red Hat’s OpenStack product offerings. Since the launch of the program in April 2013, hundreds of software, plug-ins, and hardware systems have been added to the list of certified and supported OpenStack commercial solutions. The partners building these solutions work closely with Red Hat to offer customers an enterprise-ready and commercial-grade OpenStack infrastructure, with complementary technologies integrated across compute, networking and storage. The Red Hat OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure Partner Network includes industry leading partners from around the world, including independent hardware vendors (IHVs), original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), system integrators (SIs), managed service providers (MSPs), and communication service providers (CSPs) who have joined the program to provide certified solutions and launch their own practices to support customer deployments.</p>
<p>Solutions that have achieved Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Certification, or which are certified for other products in Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud portfolio, are available in the Red Hat Certified Solution Marketplace.</p>
<p>StackStorm will host a meetup on OpenStack automation on October 14 in Palo Alto, CA. Get more information and RSVP at: <a href=http://bit.ly/1qFNLXN>http://bit.ly/1qFNLXN</a></p>
