<p>PALO ALTO, Calif.–(<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)–StackStorm, a software company leading the third wave of operations automation, today announced it will host a Cloud Online Meetup on Wednesday, December 10 focused on deployment and ongoing troubleshooting and remediation use cases on both OpenStack and AWS environments. During the meetup, Evan Powell, co-founder and CEO, and Patrick Hoolboom, DevOps engineer, StackStorm, will discuss challenges with existing automation that motivated the development of StackStorm, as well as give a demonstration of the company’s automation as a service software, which was recently released and is now freely available as open source software […]</p>
<p>“Automation that integrates an environment is fundamental to DevOps, but over time this automation can become technical debt which becomes the constraint holding back progress,” said Powell. “This meetup is an opportunity to share our experiences with approaches to automation, as well as explore how StackStorm software wires together user environments. Our goal is for attendees to gain a better understanding of how automation as a service software can simplify integrations, event handling and workflows for both OpenStack and non-OpenStack infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Organized by Rafael Knuth, OpenStack community manager, and Stephen Spector, HP cloud evangelist, the Cloud Online Meetup provides a forum for IT community members to come together and learn about new tools in the OpenStack and adjacent cloud ecosystems.</p>
<p>“The Cloud Online Meetup is the online source for all things OpenStack and cloud related,” said Knuth. “We look forward to hosting this session with Evan and Patrick to learn more about StackStorm’s technology and how it will address challenges with DevOps automation.”</p>
