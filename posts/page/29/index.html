<p>For this I’ll be using Virtualbox and Vagrant.  To use the same environment, just clone this repo:</p>
<p>St2Express</p>
<p>Once you do, you simply run:</p>
<p>It takes a few minutes for this to fully provision, but one it does you can connect to the host with the vagrant ssh command.</p>

<p>Within the StackStorm community repo there is a script called metagenerator.py. If you run this script against an existing fabfile, it will generate all the necessary meta data to add the Fabric tasks into St2 as actions. Also included with this integration is an action needed to execute the actions.</p>
<p>To get setup you need to clone this repo to somewhere on your machine:</p>
<p>Once you have the repo cloned, cd into fabric/actions</p>

How StackStorm “Stacks” Against The Competiton

<p>StackStorm connects events to actions you might want to take; and it does so through simple abstractions that allow you to reuse your approaches to managing events and to taking actions, including filtering events and applying rules and workflows. We call this sharing your <em>operational patterns</em>.</p>
<p>The approach of connecting events to actions is extremely extensible as events ranging from Nagios alerts to direct human interactions and actions from closing a ticket to interacting via our flavor of Hubot (“Stackbot”) can be tied together transparently, so they are easy to share, to manage and to control. Because of this flexibility, StackStorm solves many different problems for users, from helping with CI/CD through troubleshooting and remediation. And so StackStorm capabilities overlap to some extent with existing solutions. While we compare StackStorm to a number of such tools, StackStorm embraces the tool chain approach of DevOps operators.</p>

[Press Release] StackStorm To Present Demo On Smart Automation At OpenStack Summit Paris
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
<p><strong>October 29, 2014</strong></p>
<p>PALO ALTO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–StackStorm, a software company leading the third wave of operations automation, today announced it will present on “Automating OpenStack/AWS Environments without Technical Debt” in the Sponsor Demo Theater at OpenStack Summit Paris on November 4. During the demo, Evan Powell, co-founder and CEO of StackStorm, will explore how to leverage StackStorm automation software in OpenStack and AWS environments.</p>
<p>“If you are not careful, the automation you write to speed things up can become technical debt that slows you down,” said Powell. “The StackStorm software we are open sourcing and demoing helps users better integrate, author, manage and scale their automation. This enables them to avoid the creation of technical debt and experience the benefits of a highly automated environment in CI/CD, troubleshooting, remediation, security event management and more.”</p>

Event Observations From DevOps Enterprise and Bank Of America / Merrill Lynch Technology Innovation Summit
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
<p><strong>October 24, 2014</strong></p>
<p><em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p>This week’s DevOps Enterprise Summit 2014 (#DOES14) and Bank of America / Merrill Lynch Technology Innovation Summit (#BofAMLTech) have both been great experiences for StackStorm. In this blog I’d like to share a couple of observations that may be of broad interest.</p>
<p><strong>1. Soft stuff being addressed:</strong></p>
<p>DevOps is about much more than tools. It is fundamentally about a better way of designing, building and operating technology. It all comes down to people working better together as a team. That much we all know.</p>
<p>So I was not surprised when many speakers mentioned the above points. I was, however, somewhat surprised that Bank of America, Barclay’s, Target and many other organizations said they are successfully addressing both the quality of their teams in terms of training and expertise and the ways that they are being convinced or at least encouraged to adopt a better way of working. In the case of Barclay’s, Owen Gardner did a great job speaking about the need to get thousands of teams working in a more agile, DevOps friendly way and how this ruled out a just incremental approach since if you trained 50 teams a week you’d never get there. In their case they engineered an ingenious process to basically “infect” (my summation) the teams with DevOps.</p>

OpenStack Automation Meetup: Impressions

<p><strong>October 15, 2014</strong></p>
<p><em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p>Last night StackStorm hosted a San Francisco / Silicon Valley OpenStack Meetup at our offices in Palo Alto. Our CTO and co-founder Dmitri Zimine – who is one of the world’s experts at operations automation – led the group through a review of twenty OpenStack projects that have to do with operations automation.</p>
<p>I won’t walk you through all the content. You can see some of it in his recent series of articles for Opensource.com for example here.</p>

<p><strong>October 8, 2014</strong></p>
<p><em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p>In part one of this blog series we discussed the first and second waves of operations automation and how they’ve paved the way for the emerging third wave. In part two, we’ll discuss the importance and impact of the third wave.</p>
<p>**Why do we need another wave, and why is it like the first? **</p>
<p>Across many domains in IT you see waves such as those we are witnessing in the automation space today. A few important changes that are forcing change on many pieces of IT include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Abstraction is powerful, but “too much” is bad</strong></p>
<p>We hear this all the time from our DevOps users. They want to be able to achieve the benefits of automation – and to improve the lives of their operators, developers and especially their end users.</p>
