<p><em><strong>StackStorm delivers enhanced productivity within highly automated DevOps environments; expands team to drive growth in open source community</strong></em></p>
<p>PARIS (OpenStack Summit 2014, booth E2) – November 3, 2014 –<!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a software company leading the third wave of operations automation, today announced the release of StackStorm 0.5, open source software for operations automation. Available in private beta since spring 2014, the open source software is now accessible for technology companies and enterprises to manage the integration and automation of their environments, such as tying together continuous integration (CI), continuous deployments (CD), ongoing troubleshooting and remediation and more.</p>
<p>To keep pace with increasing business demands and to expand the company’s presence in the open source community, StackStorm has also brought on new team members that have contributed to progress in DevOps and OpenStack. Former operations hacker at GitHub and PuppetLabs, James Fryman has joined as a DevOps Stormer, and Tomaz Muraus, project chair of Apache Libcloud who most recently worked at Rackspace, has taken on the role of software engineer. In addition, Don Jaworski, member of the board of directors at SwiftStack and a well-regarded leader and advisor of infrastructure companies, has joined as an advisor.</p>

<p>Today <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we are excited to announce the open-source availability of StackStorm<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, our operations automation software.</p>
<p>StackStorm ties together your existing infrastructure and application environment so you can more easily automate that environment — with a particular focus on taking actions in response to events.</p>
<p>With StackStorm you define, and share – <em>as code</em> – your operational patterns from events and triggers through to actions taken in response.</p>
<p>Whether it is wiring together your continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) environments in a transparent way, or automating your troubleshooting and even remediation (including responses to security events, or any of the other common patterns you perform each day manually or with the help of siloed automation), StackStorm helps.</p>

<p>For this I’ll be using Virtualbox and Vagrant.  To use the same environment, just clone this repo:</p>

<p>Once you do, you simply run:</p>

<p>Within the StackStorm <!-- raw HTML omitted -->community repo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> there is a script called metagenerator.py. If you run this script against an existing fabfile, it will generate all the necessary meta data to add the Fabric tasks into St2 as actions. Also included with this integration is an action needed to execute the actions.</p>
<p>To get setup you need to clone this repo to somewhere on your machine:</p>

<p>StackStorm connects events to actions you might want to take; and it does so through simple abstractions that allow you to reuse your approaches to managing events and to taking actions, including filtering events and applying rules and workflows. We call this sharing your <em>operational patterns</em>.</p>
<p>The approach of connecting events to actions is extremely extensible as events ranging from Nagios alerts to direct human interactions and actions from closing a ticket to interacting via our flavor of Hubot (“Stackbot”) can be tied together transparently, so they are easy to share, to manage and to control. Because of this flexibility, StackStorm solves many different problems for users, from helping with CI/CD through troubleshooting and remediation. And so StackStorm capabilities overlap to some extent with existing solutions. While we compare StackStorm to a number of such tools, StackStorm embraces the tool chain approach of DevOps operators.</p>

<p>PALO ALTO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–StackStorm, a software company leading the third wave of operations automation, today announced it will present on “Automating OpenStack/AWS Environments without Technical Debt” in the Sponsor Demo Theater at OpenStack Summit Paris on November 4. During the demo, Evan Powell, co-founder and CEO of StackStorm, will explore how to leverage StackStorm automation software in OpenStack and AWS environments.</p>
<p>“If you are not careful, the automation you write to speed things up can become technical debt that slows you down,” said Powell. “The StackStorm software we are open sourcing and demoing helps users better integrate, author, manage and scale their automation. This enables them to avoid the creation of technical debt and experience the benefits of a highly automated environment in CI/CD, troubleshooting, remediation, security event management and more.”</p>

        Event Observations From DevOps Enterprise and Bank Of America / Merrill Lynch Technology Innovation Summit

      <p><strong>October 24, 2014</strong></p>
<p><em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p>This week’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevOps Enterprise Summit 2014<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#DOES14<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and Bank of America / Merrill Lynch Technology Innovation Summit (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#BofAMLTech<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) have both been great experiences for StackStorm. In this blog I’d like to share a couple of observations that may be of broad interest.</p>
<p><strong>1. Soft stuff being addressed:</strong></p>
<p>DevOps is about much more than tools. It is fundamentally about a better way of designing, building and operating technology. It all comes down to people working better together as a team. That much we all know.</p>
<p>So I was not surprised when many speakers mentioned the above points. I was, however, somewhat surprised that Bank of America, Barclay’s, Target and many other organizations said they are successfully addressing both the quality of their teams in terms of training and expertise and the ways that they are being convinced or at least encouraged to adopt a better way of working. In the case of Barclay’s, Owen Gardner did a great job speaking about the need to get thousands of teams working in a more agile, DevOps friendly way and how this ruled out a just incremental approach since if you trained 50 teams a week you’d never get there. In their case they engineered an ingenious process to basically “infect” (my summation) the teams with DevOps.</p>
