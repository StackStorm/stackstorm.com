        What Is Mistral And Why StackStorm Cares: Workflow Service For Cloud Automation

<p>At StackStorm, we believe that workflow is a key ingredient for cloud automation. That’s why we became drivers and core contributors to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mistral<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a new workflow service for OpenStack.</p>
<p>Why the need for a new workflow service? Haven’t we already experienced Workflow Management? Aren’t a number of established, mature workflow products<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> out there already? Yes, and yes, but…</p>
<p>With a decade of experience building system orchestration and automation products<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and seeing them used in the field, I realized that using a traditional BPM (business process management) oriented workflow is not a good match with today’s pace of change and scale of operations. The rich variety of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->workflow patterns<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are bragged about by traditional BPM systems are never used in practice. The graphical representation of workflow, so exciting for non-technical BPM users, becomes a handcuff for techy admins. And complex XML-based syntax made working with workflow definition files a nightmare.</p>

<p>DevOps is all about the community movement – it’s an approach that is inherently collaborative. That’s why we love attending DevOps events and sharing ideas with others in the industry. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevOps Days Silicon Valley<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is around the corner and we’re expecting to see some great sessions. It’s the fifth anniversary for the conference, and we’re happy to be part of the program this year!</p>
<p>Patrick Hoolboom, an avid Stormer and contributor to our blog, will be presenting on the “10 Reasons Why DevOps is the Greatest Shift in the IT Industry.” There is a huge shift in IT towards a DevOps approach for building and operating software, with the goal of improving productivity. Conferences like DevOps Days are evidence of this shift and growth in the community.</p>

<p><em>by Patrick Hoolboom</em></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time talking about the positive effects of moving to a more DevOps oriented approach. The reasoning behind this because I truly believe it, and get excited just thinking about it. An interesting thing I have found is that, when explaining these concepts and what StackStorm is about to non-technical people, I almost always get the same question:</p>
<p><strong><em>“If DevOps is so great, why isn’t everyone doing it?”</em></strong></p>
<p>This is a perfectly valid question, so I thought I’d try to break it down into what I see as the biggest barriers to entry for a truly successful DevOps initiative. I thought back about the various places I have worked, or the reasons I have heard for not wanting to move away from the Operations/Development silo approach and was able to distill them down to 3 points (actually 4 but the last one seems to be wrapped up in the other three).</p>

<p>Over the years I’ve helped literally thousands of customers gain efficiencies in their data centers. I’ve met and become friendly with a lot of IT pros but I’ve got to admit – I never envied them. Well, maybe I envied some of the views in NY and Jersey City. And some of the toys they got to play with over the years were amazing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I didn’t envy them because many of my friends in director and VP roles spent a huge percentage of their time fighting politics that resulted in Orwellian distortions of the truth. A couple of stories from the early 2000s might help illustrate my point:</p>
<p><strong>1. Two guys pulling all-nighters delivering a $1.5B roll out of IP communications while 25+ project managers debate progress from 9-5</strong></p>
<p>The headline pretty much captures it. This now too-big-to-fail bank, as well as their vendor, had brought in several project and program managers to ensure groups from facilities through supply chain through security and operations were “aligned.” I spent a couple of meetings getting to know all of these project managers before realizing that there were two guys working every night, all night, to manually, using fingers and spreadsheets, push and validate changes. Eventually those operators quit – and the project ground to a halt.</p>

<p>While I am a third time founding CEO who has helped build some successful infrastructure software companies, I’m continuously learning. I don’t have a particular formula for how to build the right combination of market positioning, company capabilities, company tactics, strategies, and more.</p>
<p>In leading companies I rely on my own broad experience, common frameworks from Michael Porter and others, and surrounding myself with people smarter than me who are unafraid to show it.</p>
<p>I believe each company takes on a certain personality – a sense of the company that can be felt. This is where design thinking perhaps comes to play.</p>
<p>For example, whereas Nexenta was generally a scrappy company that needed to break the rules to shake the status quo, StackStorm’s personality is more that of a relatively polished upstart that expects to be the best at everything it does.</p>
