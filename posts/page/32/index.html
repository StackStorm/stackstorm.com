A Look Back At The Successes Of OpenStack, And Some Emerging Challenges

<p><em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p>As an entrepreneur betting heavily – in time, money, and relationships – on OpenStack, I’m biased towards its success and more than a little interested in how it is growing up. I have long believed in open infrastructure and remain convinced that OpenStack is the best chance we all have for a future of greater innovation, quality, capability, and, yes, affordability for cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>I first looked at OpenStack a number of years ago when growing Nexenta and creating a market we then called the OpenStorage market, and recently took some time to look at the entire project and how far it’s come, as well as some emerging challenges.</p>

Automating OpenStack: Join StackStorm’s Online Meetup July 17

<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
<p><strong>July 11, 2014</strong></p>
<p><em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p>We’re looking forward to co-hosting next week’s OpenStack Online Meetup on July 17! Hosted by Rafael Knuth, OpenStack and Hadoop community manager and Stephen Spector, HP cloud evangelist, the meetup is a great forum to bring together the OpenStack IT community from across the world, to facilitate dialogue and share ideas, especially on new technologies.</p>
<p>In the meetup, our CTO and co-founder, Dmitri Zimine, will discuss automation approaches and projects within the OpenStack ecosystem. As we’ve mentioned <a href=http://stackstorm.com/2014/05/08/day-three-openstack-important-however-users-pragmatic-agnostic-ever/>before</a>, we’re big believers in OpenStack. It’s one of the largest open source projects in the world, and the community and corporate supporters of the community have made broad OpenStack adoption almost inevitable. We particularly like the OpenStack mantra “automate all the things.”</p>
<p>With the rise of OpenStack and similar approaches comes a more open environment comprised of loosely coupled components, each of which can be automated itself. Add the massive acceleration in the rate of change occasioned by agile and DevOps approaches to management and IT has an entirely new environment to manage. And automation is at the very core of current approaches to management.</p>

What Is Mistral And Why StackStorm Cares: Workflow Service For Cloud Automation
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
<p><strong>July 7, 2014</strong><br>
<em>by Dmitri Zimine</em></p>
<p>At StackStorm, we believe that workflow is a key ingredient for cloud automation. That’s why we became drivers and core contributors to Mistral, a new workflow service for OpenStack.</p>
<p>Why the need for a new workflow service? Haven’t we already experienced Workflow Management? Aren’t a number of established, mature workflow products[1] out there already? Yes, and yes, but…</p>
<p>With a decade of experience building system orchestration and automation products[2] and seeing them used in the field, I realized that using a traditional BPM (business process management) oriented workflow is not a good match with today’s pace of change and scale of operations. The rich variety of workflow patterns that are bragged about by traditional BPM systems are never used in practice. The graphical representation of workflow, so exciting for non-technical BPM users, becomes a handcuff for techy admins. And complex XML-based syntax made working with workflow definition files a nightmare.</p>
