StackStorm was recently invited to speak on [HangOps] to discuss a growing trend in IT Operations – event driven automation. I spoke with Brandon Burton and other community members about the basic concepts of event driven automation and how StackStorm enables companies of all sizes start or continue their journey implementing DevOps practices. Topics discussed in this podcast include: Intersecting Event Driven Infrastructure with ChatOps, Practical Use-cases for StackStorm, and future growth of the platform and community at large.

<p>At StackStorm, we want to enable our users to take advantage of everything our product has to offer, as well as provide feedback to us on the latest features as quickly as possible. In this spirit, we plan to share weekly updates regarding our progress, including new integration packs, improvements on existing packs, platform updates, and any tools created to help streamline the automation process. Our announcements will highlight both StackStorm-developed integrations as well as community contributions. We hope to be able to provide an overview of what has happened throughout the week as well as point out anything exciting that we see coming down the pipeline.</p>
<h6 id=community>COMMUNITY</h6>

Changes to our main community repo, StackStorm Exchange, include:</p>
<p><strong>New Relic</strong><br>
This week we introduced the first iteration of our New Relic integration pack. It comes with actions for getting alerts and metric data from the New Relic API.</p>

<p>StackStorm v0.6.0 was recently released. This release includes many new features, bug-fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>One of the new features this release brings is user content sandboxing and isolation. In this post we will share why we have done this, and what benefits this brings to our users. We’ll also take a quick technical dive and look at the implementation details.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS CONTENT PACK SANDBOXING AND ISOLATION?</strong></p>
<p>Users integrate StackStorm with 3rd party systems (AWS, OpenStack, Puppet, Git, JIRA, Libcloud, etc.) and extend its functionality by installing one of the official or user-contributed packs from the StackStorm Exchange.</p>

<p>It’s been one month and 5 days since we open sourced StackStorm during the OpenStack summit in Paris. Since then, our team has had our heads down developing the software, checking off the items on the roadmap, and applying learnings from the field and feedback from community users to our product.</p>
<p>I am happy to share that we’ve just released a new version of StackStorm — v0.6.0.</p>
<p><strong>What’s new?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. YAML for all content</strong></p>
<p>Moving to YAML for all content was the top ask from the community: many found dealing with JSON a bit cumbersome. Now all StackStorm content artifacts — rules, action and trigger definitions, and ActionChain workflows – are defined as YAML. JSON is supported for backward compatibility.</p>

At the recent OpenStack Summit in Paris, I had a chance to meet with StackStorm, a software operations automation company who announcedthe release of StackStorm 0.5, open source software for operations automation. I recorded a Podcast with their CEO and technology evangelist.

<p>I’ve spoken at a couple of events, and chatted with hundreds of people at these events about an idea that has been swirling around in my head for a while now. This idea has gnawed at my subconscious throughout a big part of my career in IT Operations, but I was never really able to put my finger on what was bothering me. I just knew that lack of visibility and consistency in procedures drove me crazy. The opaque nature of action performed during an outage, or even a scheduled operation was frustrating. Post mortems were a nightmare of hazy memories, chat transcripts, and various permutations of ad hoc log parsing.</p>

<p>I’ve done a couple articles about getting StackStorm set up, an introductory video, and put a fair amount of effort towards minimizing the barrier to entry for new users.  Overall, I think StackStorm was successful in providing a quick and easy way to get our system up and running but users need more than that.  Users need to see how StackStorm can help solve their specific pain points.  We needed a way to illustrate that we can provide an easy to use solution without the steep learning curve of throwing out your existing tools.  Over a series of a few blog posts we are going to go over some of the ways that we have leveraged the StackStorm platform internally and how these solutions could map to your environment.</p>
