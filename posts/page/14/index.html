<p>Big change can be daunting. For us – from working in a tiny startup to a big Fortune 500 corporation. For you – from dealing with a tiny startup, to dealing with a big Fortune 500 company.</p>
<p>Those of you who invested your effort (and money!) in stackstorm have been understandably concerned of our future. We spent time reaching out to our customers and large users. We are still catching up with explaining the transition, and adding answers to new questions as they come up; <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/04/11/brocade-acquisition-faq/">check out FAQ</a> and if there’s something you care to ask, please ask. Here, I’ll reflect on the first 14 days at Brocade, report our status to our dear OpenSource community, and share my first impressions and observations.</p>

<p>I’m “pretty excited” to share some news, we’ve just finished integrating Cisco Spark into StackStorm, via our automation-bot, Hubot.<br>
This means you can get all of the power of StackStorm chatops from within Cisco Spark rooms and collaboration experiences.</p>

<p>Cisco Spark delivers cloud-based business communications that enables customers to message, meet and call anyone, whether it be on their mobile device, desktop or meeting room end-points.</p>

<p>StackStorm is an event-driven automation platform that ties together every component of your environment. It’s commonly used for auto-remediation—including response to security events—and other cases such as complex deployments.</p>

        The Brief History of ChatOps at StackStorm (and How We Got Here)
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p><strong>February 25, 2016</strong><br>
<em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p>These days ChatOps has become all the rage. In this blog I’ll talk a little bit about how we came to be here – in a leading position when it comes to ChatOps adoption for operations. And I’ll point you to some resources from users and our own engineers to learn more.</p>
<p>The history lesson will be brief, I promise.</p>
<p>We started StackStorm after observing that existing solutions in the devops universe were generally point solutions, often evolved from scripts and other projects that DevOps engineers wrote to make their own lives easier. And that’s a great way to build a solution that appeals at least to those types of users for those specific use cases.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What we saw was that while there were leaders within certain segments amongst those tools, there was no clearly adopted pattern for the wiring that tied all these tools together. Moreover, with our backgrounds in enterprises we knew that wiring together extremely heterogeneous environments is always a challenge. The enterprise is more a brownfield than a greenfield.</p>
<p>A quick shout out to teams at Facebook and at WebEx Spark and all those other early interviewees that taught us so much about event driven automation. And if you want to join a non commercial Bay Area meet-up about the subject and hear speakers from organizations like Facebook and LinkedIn and Netflix, please join here:<br>

<em>by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon Middleton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Optimisation Project Lead @ Pulsant Limited</em></p>
<p>In the post <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm QuickTip: ChatOps your pack dev workflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> James Fryman gave a ChatOPS alias recipe to reduce the friction for deploying packs and then in the <em>Random Thoughts</em> section asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This action is tied directly to the <code>packs.install</code>. What about a workflow? Seems like that would be a better way to structure this.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonated with me as I had already started working on an internal pack that did just that, as I thought attempting to deploy a pack via an alias (and action) contained within the same pack would be madness (or just lead to interesting race conditions). In the last week, our <em>Pull Request</em> has been merged, documentation has been included in st2docs (<a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/chatops/pack_deploy.html">link</a>) for a workflow that fulfils the above random thought and should be released with 1.4.</p>
<p>So introducing <code>packs.deploy</code>, an action written in Mistral to handle the mapping of names for Git repositories to the information required to carry out the <code>packs.install</code> action.</p>

<p>Less than a week ago Microsoft announced a plan to activate Yammer — its corporate social network — for every customer with Office 365 subscription. Yammer will be seamlessly turned on for everyone with a business or education account over the next two months, which means more and more people will rely on it in their daily communication. Pretty exciting!</p>
<p>If you’re a long-time StackStorm user, chances are you already know what’s going to happen. After all, we only write articles with words like “pretty exciting” in them when we have something great to show, and this one is no exception: today we’re proud to announce <strong>ChatOps integration with Yammer</strong> for both Community and Enterprise editions of StackStorm!</p>
<p>If you’re new to ChatOps, it’s a chat-centric way to enable or extend DevOps — especially when based upon StackStorm. With the help of our powerful rules engine, workflows, and more, you can execute actions from your chat app of choice, keep it visible for your team, and grow your automation patterns over time. Naturally, our own blog has a lot of articles on the topic, like the recent <em><a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/02/03/on-force-multiplication-and-event-driven-automation/">On Force Multiplication and Event-driven Automation</a></em> by James Fryman.</p>
