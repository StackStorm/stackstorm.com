<p>Want to install StackStorm on a machine that doesn’t have access to the internet? If you’ve got another box on your local network that connects to the public network, you can do this by making it a local package repository server. In this post, we’ll walk you through steps for setting up an apt-mirror server with the required packages and configuring the <strong>offline</strong> client machine to quickly get a full StackStorm installation up and running!</p>

<p><em>Warning: this post describes a long set of important changes. It is enormous in size and full of cheesy puns, feelings, and heart emojis. You might prefer to <a href=docs.stackstorm.com/packs.html>read the documentation</a> if that is not what you are into. Otherwise, grab a favorite caffeinated drink of your choice and let’s begin!</em></p>
<p>A little while ago we <a href=https://stackstorm.com/2016/12/06/2-1-new-pack-management/>rolled out StackStorm 2.1</a>, a release focused on one primary theme: integration packs.</p>
<p>StackStorm pack management infrastructure is evolving with the demand. As the number of integration packs grows, we want to provide means for faster and easier deployment, make pack development more productive, and encourage collaboration. There are dozens of changes making it happen—both in our internal infrastructure and the StackStorm core—and we are excited and hopeful that through better experience with integration packs, working with StackStorm will become even more efficient, easy, and fun.</p>
<p>As it is the case with all “thematic” releases, 2.1 is more than just a set of features and changes. It has a lot of context around it, and more importantly, it has a story—and this is a story we are now going to tell.</p>

<p>At DevOps Enterprise Summit 2016, DevOps leaders like Target, American Airlines, Disney, and Quicken Loans spoke of the importance of managing/optimizing operations, addressing technical debt, eliminating silos, collaboration, and the importance of open source and community to drive innovation. I was especially struck by Jason Cox of Disney, who stressed the importance of “creating a culture of courage” where teams are encouraged to be curious, to experiment, explore and embrace change across process, roles, and technology-all for the purpose of enabling meaningful work.</p>
<p>It turns out that these themes are being talked about not only by these large Enterprise DevOps leaders. These themes are being repeated in conversations around the globe with IT leaders who are looking to leverage DevOps practices to successfully drive innovation and digital transformation.</p>
<p>Anthony Shaw, Group Director of Innovation and Technical Talent at Dimension Data has seen this first hand. Anthony not only leads innovation efforts within Dimension Data-but he also travels the world speaking with customers about their business priorities, their Digital Transformation goals, and how the innovative use of technology, organizational structure, community, and transforming day to day operational practices can accelerate their Digital Transformation journey.</p>

<p>Recently we explained how to use <a href=https://stackstorm.com/2016/10/21/auto-remediation-stackstorm-splunk/><strong>Syslog with Splunk & StackStorm</strong></a> to auto-remediate a link going down on a switch. Splunk is a widely used log management tool but there’s also a popular open source alternative – <a href=https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack><strong>Elastic Stack</strong></a> (formerly the ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana). So if you’re using the Elastic Stack, and are looking to automate event remediation in your environment, you’re at the right place! In this post, we’re taking the same <a href=https://stackstorm.com/2016/10/21/auto-remediation-stackstorm-splunk/>use case as before</a> and talking about how to set up the Elastic stack to collect syslog data and trigger event-based network remediation workflows using <strong>StackStorm</strong>.</p>

Just in case you missed it, we published StackStorm v2.1.1 late last week. This is a minor update, on top of the major changes to pack management we made with 2.1.
There’s a few small bugfixes and enhancements:
core.http now supports HTTP basic auth and digest authentication. Local action runner supports unicode parameter keys and values. Improved error handling and more user-friendly messages for packs commands and APIs.

<p>Ta-da! It’s here! StackStorm version 2.1 has been released, and there are some big changes. So big that we started wondering if we should have called this release version 3.0. Pack management has had a <em>lot</em> of work done, and we think you’ll be pleased with the results. Plus good news for those patiently waiting for Ubuntu 16.04LTS support!</p>
<h2 id=packs-packs-packs8230its-mostly-all-about-packs>Packs Packs Packs…it’s (mostly) all about Packs</h2>
<p>The big theme for this release is Pack Management. We’ve upgraded, enhanced, overhauled & refitted pack management, and we’re very pleased to introduce the <a href=https://exchange.stackstorm.org>StackStorm Exchange</a></p>
