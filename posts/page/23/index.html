<p>Day in and day out, the team at StackStorm is building tools that take away pain from the daily lives of Operations and Developers in IT Departments everywhere. We do this by focusing our efforts on absorbing all the Glue Code, the small snippets of code that tie together tools in your organization, and relieving the developer and operator of much of the traditional management overhead associated with automations. We also need to make sure that the tools we provide <em>around</em> StackStorm are equally enjoyable and frictionless to use. To that end, I would like to share with you how to rapidly build integrations with our integrated development environment, <code>st2workroom</code>.</p>
<h6 id="what-is-stackstorm">What is StackStorm?</h6>
<p>If you’re just getting started with StackStorm, or are curious what it is, we have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great primer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the product… Take a moment, head over there, and give it a quick read or watch. We’ll be right here when you get back.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, StackStorm provides Event Driven Automation. StackStorm integrates with your various tools, and manages orchestration based on events that occur in your environment.</p>

        How StackStorm Partnered With Rackspace DevOps And New Relic To Deliver A Workflow To Automatically Scale

<p><em>by James Fryman</em></p>
<p><em>This article originally appeared on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New Relic’s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</em></p>
<p>I am hard pressed to think of a challenge in operations today as complex as Infrastructure Autoscaling. In this single use case several unique subsystems must all play in concert to facilitate the delivery of computing resources with little or no human involvement. Done right, it is difficult to deny the magic of a workflow coming together to provide truly elastic infrastructure.</p>
<p>But the challenges in a real-world implementation of an autoscaling infrastructure are many, with one of the chief issues being a lack of flexibility. Many organizations have large investments in existing processes and technologies. When an autoscaling solution doesn’t allow for integration with a specific monitoring service, or users want additional control on how machines are managed, the end result is often to avoid the integration altogether or build custom code.</p>
<p>All this being said, when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was approached by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rackspace DevOps<!-- raw HTML omitted -->organization to help solve for custom workflows, we jumped at the opportunity! Who doesn’t love a good challenge? In the course of about a week, we were able to create a fully working solution composed of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rackspace Cloud infrastructure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New Relic alerting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and, of course, StackStorm. What I hope to share with you today is just how easy complex tasks like workflow automation can be tailored to your specific flavor of infrastructure.</p>

<p>It’s been another exciting week here at StackStorm. Feedback is pouring in and we are all busy addressing it and cranking out new features. Thank you for your wonderful input and appreciation. Here is a recap of what we did this week:</p>
<h6 id="stackstorm-platform">StackStorm Platform</h6>
<p>We’ve turned on authentication by default for package based deployments. In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->st2express<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we have a simple file based auth as proof of concept. It might be a good time to read about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->setting up auth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in StackStorm. We also improved the sensor container to automatically load/unload/reload sensors on sensor model create/delete/update events. You can now simply write a sensor, register it with StackStorm and the sensor is picked up automatically. Perhaps it’s time for you to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hack a sensor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and contribute to our growing list of packs in our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm Exchange<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 😉 Look out for some of these features that will be rolled out as part of our 0.9 release. A lot of bug fixes and user improvements went into the master. Check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->changelog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for more info.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks we have hit an inflection point in that downloads are running at 5-7x February levels, IRC chats are getting more and more substantive, and folks like Rackspace and others are contributing to StackStorm (thank you! – let’s automate all the things – <em>intelligently</em> – together :)).</p>
<p>Here are some highlights including a few events at which we attended and spoke:</p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Security BSides Ljubljana<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> – our own Tomaz Muraus spoke at BSides in Slovenia about using StackStorm as IFTTT-like software for responding to security events.

<p>One might think with all the efforts behind the 0.8 release, we’d take some much deserved time off — but alas, no such luck! There are too many important and exciting things to do around here. Without further ado, here is what we’ve been up to:</p>
<h6 id="stackstorm-platform">STACKSTORM PLATFORM</h6>
<p>With the 0.8 release out into the wild, we quickly pushed out a few patch releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>v0.8.1 – This was somewhat larger than expected for our first patch, but it included some scale improvements to support the brand new UI (have you tried it yet?). Then we got greedy and added a few more fixes while we worked on some patch mechanics. Bug fixes, scale improvements and some additive features.
<ul>
<li>See <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v0.8.1">https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v0.8.1</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>

<li>v0.8.2 – Targeted bug fixes in the action runner space.
