How StackStorm Partnered With Rackspace DevOps And New Relic To Deliver A Workflow To Automatically Scale
</a>

<p><strong>March 30, 2015</strong></p>
<p><em>by James Fryman</em></p>
<p><em>This article originally appeared on New Relic’s blog.</em></p>
<p>I am hard pressed to think of a challenge in operations today as complex as Infrastructure Autoscaling. In this single use case several unique subsystems must all play in concert to facilitate the delivery of computing resources with little or no human involvement. Done right, it is difficult to deny the magic of a workflow coming together to provide truly elastic infrastructure.</p>
<p>But the challenges in a real-world implementation of an autoscaling infrastructure are many, with one of the chief issues being a lack of flexibility. Many organizations have large investments in existing processes and technologies. When an autoscaling solution doesn’t allow for integration with a specific monitoring service, or users want additional control on how machines are managed, the end result is often to avoid the integration altogether or build custom code.</p>
<p>All this being said, when StackStorm was approached by the Rackspace DevOpsorganization to help solve for custom workflows, we jumped at the opportunity! Who doesn’t love a good challenge? In the course of about a week, we were able to create a fully working solution composed of Rackspace Cloud infrastructure, New Relic alerting, and, of course, StackStorm. What I hope to share with you today is just how easy complex tasks like workflow automation can be tailored to your specific flavor of infrastructure.</p>

<p>It’s been another exciting week here at StackStorm. Feedback is pouring in and we are all busy addressing it and cranking out new features. Thank you for your wonderful input and appreciation. Here is a recap of what we did this week:</p>
<h6 id=stackstorm-platform>StackStorm Platform</h6>
<p>We’ve turned on authentication by default for package based deployments. In st2express, we have a simple file based auth as proof of concept. It might be a good time to read about setting up auth in StackStorm. We also improved the sensor container to automatically load/unload/reload sensors on sensor model create/delete/update events. You can now simply write a sensor, register it with StackStorm and the sensor is picked up automatically. Perhaps it’s time for you to hack a sensor and contribute to our growing list of packs in our StackStorm Exchange 😉 Look out for some of these features that will be rolled out as part of our 0.9 release. A lot of bug fixes and user improvements went into the master. Check out the changelog for more info.</p>

<p><em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p>The last couple of weeks we have hit an inflection point in that downloads are running at 5-7x February levels, IRC chats are getting more and more substantive, and folks like Rackspace and others are contributing to StackStorm (thank you! – let’s automate all the things – <em>intelligently</em> – together :)).</p>
<p>Here are some highlights including a few events at which we attended and spoke:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security BSides Ljubljana – our own Tomaz Muraus spoke at BSides in Slovenia about using StackStorm as IFTTT-like software for responding to security events. Being Tomas, he didn’t just speak with some nice looking slides – he also demo’d and made available the code for the remediations he demonstrated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please take a look here:  Tomaz’s amazing slides</p>

<p>One might think with all the efforts behind the 0.8 release, we’d take some much deserved time off — but alas, no such luck! There are too many important and exciting things to do around here. Without further ado, here is what we’ve been up to:</p>
<h6 id=stackstorm-platform>STACKSTORM PLATFORM</h6>
<p>With the 0.8 release out into the wild, we quickly pushed out a few patch releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>v0.8.1 – This was somewhat larger than expected for our first patch, but it included some scale improvements to support the brand new UI (have you tried it yet?). Then we got greedy and added a few more fixes while we worked on some patch mechanics. Bug fixes, scale improvements and some additive features.
<ul>
<li>See <a href=https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v0.8.1>https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v0.8.1</a></li>
</ul>

<li>v0.8.2 – Targeted bug fixes in the action runner space.

<p>Too often industry pundits like myself make our names by screaming louder than the other pundit and by making outlandish projections in the hopes of cutting through the clutter, building our twitter followers, and otherwise achieving more pundit points.</p>
<p>Currently, I hear the extremists shouting about Chef vs. Docker and Docker vs. Rocket and Docker vs. OpenStack. I guess I hear a lot about Docker.</p>
<p>Last week, as an example, I heard folks clearly smarter than me making some pretty aggressive statements at the Pacific Crest Emerging Technology Summit, where I was one of the Mosaic experts PacCrest asked to speak to large institutional investors about cloud and trends in enterprise IT. I also heard some diatribes at Rackspace::Solve, where Rackspace demonstrated its use of StackStorm as a foundation of their DevOps services.</p>
