<p><em><strong>The third wave of operations automation – what’s the same, what’s different, and what’s next?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m a bit uncomfortable referencing a cultural meme to kick off a weighty subject mostly interesting to the “data center intelligencia.”1 While Ben Horowitz has made it cool to refer to rap lyrics, he is a best-selling author and a billionaire and, conversely, I am decidedly neither.</p>
<p>Still, when I look at the wave of automation sweeping data centers and specifically hyperscale data centers, we face some questions not dissimilar from those that confronted LL Cool J so many years ago. So maybe I’m not totally crazy when those lyrics come to mind.  What’s new?  What’s rehashed?</p>
<p>We’ll begin by rolling the tape back to an era before DevOps, before AWS, and before VMware – even then time was already too short and systems were already too complex for humans alone to be left to our own devices.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to both attending and sponsoring the DevOps Enterprise Summit, which will take place on October 21-23 in San Francisco, CA.</p>
<p>While our product is currently in beta, sponsoring such a show is beneficial for a number of reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. Enterprise automation focus</strong></p>
<p>StackStorm is working towards a vision of self-driving data centers, and in November we’ll be releasing our open source software that will bring users closer to that goal.</p>
<p>A majority of our current beta users are enterprises that are seeking to connect their existing pockets of automation in a DevOps-friendly way. As an example, this means they hope to extend the benefits of automation from continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) – the domain of DevOps Enterprise prime sponsor ElectricCloud – into every piece of building and operating software.</p>
<p>We believe a vast number of enterprises are struggling with pockets of automation and are faced with real challenges in managing, extending, and controlling their automation environments. Given that many of these enterprises will be attending the event, we expect great conversations to unfold.</p>

<p>This is the third part in a series of three articles surveying automation projects within OpenStack, explaining what they do, how they do it, and where they stand in development readiness and field usage. Previously, in part one, I covered cloud deployment tools that enable you to install/update OpenStack cloud on bare metal. In part two, I covered workload deployment tools. Today, we’ll look at tools for day two operations.</p>
<p>Day two operations automation is all about maintaining and managing the cloud infrastructure and workload to keep it running.</p>

Catch Up With StackStorm In October!

<p><strong>September 24, 2014</strong></p>
<p>October is a busy month for us! We’re hosting a meetup in Palo Alto, exhibiting at DevOps Enterprise Summit and preparing for OpenStack Summit Paris – take a look at where StackStorm will be next month, and come by and say hello if you’re at any of these:</p>
<p><strong>San Francisco/Silicon Valley OpenStack Meetup:</strong> On <strong>Tuesday, October 14 at 6:30 p.m. PT</strong>, StackStorm is hosting a SF/SV OpenStack Meetup, Automate all the Things! Nice motto – what options do we have in OpenStack?, which will run through automation for OpenStack in all its forms. Led by our CTO, Dmitri Zimine, the meetup will review all Day 1 and Day 2 automation projects within OpenStack.</p>
<p>Dmitri is an expert in automation and has participated in many discussions with OpenStack operators, as well as, OpenStack forums and meetups. Prior to StackStorm, he was at VMware, where he led the vSphere Client team through four major releases and led a successful transition of vSphere Client to a new technology stack. During the meetup, Dmitri will provide an unbiased overview of automation projects including which projects are OpenStack specific, which are mature and which have momentum.</p>

Thoughts From OpenStack Silicon Valley: Part 2

<p>Continuing from part 1 of my blog on the recent OpenStack Silicon Valley summit, let’s discuss some of the other companies present at the conference and some of my (cynical) observations.</p>
<p>VMware was there with a keynote being given by yet another Martin. There were six substantive talks before noon. Half of them had someone named Marten or Martin in it. I’m referring here of course to VMware’s networking CTO, Martin Casado who spoke passionately about policy based management as an El Dorado of IT management that is finally within reach. I kept flashing back to the Werner Herzog film “Aguirre: Wrath of God.” Much like Klaus Kinsky in that film (spoiler alert), the quest for the golden city does not end well.</p>

<p>The OpenStack Silicon Valley summit took place on Tuesday, and I had a blast! There were a lot of recent developments discussed at the summit, including HP’s acquisition of Eucalyptus, and I had the opportunity to meet old friends and make some new. There’s a lot that took place, so I’ll split this into two blog posts. In this first one I’ll discuss some of the recent announcements and what HP and Cisco brought to the summit. In the second part, I’ll discuss VMware and some of my overall takeaways.</p>
<p>First, as is the case in any conference, much of the value is found in the hallways. I ran into a couple of StackStorm users and advisors, a bunch of friends I knew via Nexenta, and had some great honest conversations.</p>
<p>I think my first chat post coffee (when my brain started to switch on) was with Bernard Golden from ActiveState, Stephen Spector from HP, and Jesse Proudman from Blue Box. That got me into a great mood and gives you an idea of who attended – lots and lots of thoughtful folks willing to share their perspectives.</p>

No two DevOps shops are alike, but there are common threads that run throughout. So what does it take for an IT shop to successfully implement the DevOps culture?
Can an enterprise IT shop successfully adopt DevOps?
Many IT professionals working in traditional, siloed IT environments want the answer, in the name of faster, more reliable systems […]
