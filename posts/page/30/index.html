<p>Last night StackStorm hosted a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->San Francisco / Silicon Valley OpenStack Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at our offices in Palo Alto. Our CTO and co-founder Dmitri Zimine – who is one of the world’s experts at operations automation – led the group through a review of twenty OpenStack projects that have to do with operations automation.</p>
<p>I won’t walk you through all the content. You can see some of it in his recent series of articles for Opensource.com for example <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->part one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of this blog series we discussed the first and second waves of operations automation and how they’ve paved the way for the emerging third wave. In part two, we’ll discuss the importance and impact of the third wave.</p>
<p>**Why do we need another wave, and why is it like the first? **</p>
<p>Across many domains in IT you see waves such as those we are witnessing in the automation space today. A few important changes that are forcing change on many pieces of IT include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Abstraction is powerful, but “too much” is bad</strong></p>
<p>We hear this all the time from our DevOps users. They want to be able to achieve the benefits of automation – and to improve the lives of their operators, developers and especially their end users.</p>

<p><em><strong>The third wave of operations automation – what’s the same, what’s different, and what’s next?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m a bit uncomfortable referencing a cultural meme to kick off a weighty subject mostly interesting to the “data center intelligencia.”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> While Ben Horowitz has made it cool to refer to rap lyrics, he is a best-selling author and a billionaire and, conversely, I am decidedly neither.</p>
<p>Still, when I look at the wave of automation sweeping data centers and specifically hyperscale data centers, we face some questions not dissimilar from those that confronted LL Cool J so many years ago. So maybe I’m not totally crazy when those lyrics come to mind.  What’s new?  What’s rehashed?</p>
<p>We’ll begin by rolling the tape back to an era before DevOps, before AWS, and before VMware – even then time was already too short and systems were already too complex for humans alone to be left to our own devices.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to both attending and sponsoring the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevOps Enterprise Summit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which will take place on October 21-23 in San Francisco, CA.</p>
<p>While our product is currently in beta, sponsoring such a show is beneficial for a number of reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. Enterprise automation focus</strong></p>
<p>StackStorm is working towards a vision of self-driving data centers, and in November we’ll be releasing our open source software that will bring users closer to that goal.</p>
<p>A majority of our current beta users are enterprises that are seeking to connect their existing pockets of automation in a DevOps-friendly way. As an example, this means they hope to extend the benefits of automation from continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) – the domain of DevOps Enterprise prime sponsor ElectricCloud – into every piece of building and operating software.</p>
<p>We believe a vast number of enterprises are struggling with pockets of automation and are faced with real challenges in managing, extending, and controlling their automation environments. Given that many of these enterprises will be attending the event, we expect great conversations to unfold.</p>

<p>October is a busy month for us! We’re hosting a meetup in Palo Alto, exhibiting at DevOps Enterprise Summit and preparing for OpenStack Summit Paris – take a look at where StackStorm will be next month, and come by and say hello if you’re at any of these:</p>
<p><strong>San Francisco/Silicon Valley OpenStack Meetup:</strong> On <strong>Tuesday, October 14 at 6:30 p.m. PT</strong>, StackStorm is hosting a SF/SV OpenStack Meetup, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automate all the Things! Nice motto – what options do we have in OpenStack?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which will run through automation for OpenStack in all its forms. Led by our CTO, Dmitri Zimine, the meetup will review all Day 1 and Day 2 automation projects within OpenStack.</p>
<p>Dmitri is an expert in automation and has participated in many discussions with OpenStack operators, as well as, OpenStack forums and meetups. Prior to StackStorm, he was at VMware, where he led the vSphere Client team through four major releases and led a successful transition of vSphere Client to a new technology stack. During the meetup, Dmitri will provide an unbiased overview of automation projects including which projects are OpenStack specific, which are mature and which have momentum.</p>

<p>Continuing from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->part 1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of my blog on the recent OpenStack Silicon Valley summit, let’s discuss some of the other companies present at the conference and some of my (cynical) observations.</p>
<p>VMware was there with a keynote being given by yet another Martin. There were six substantive talks before noon. Half of them had someone named Marten or Martin in it. I’m referring here of course to VMware’s networking CTO, Martin Casado who spoke passionately about policy based management as an El Dorado of IT management that is finally within reach. I kept flashing back to the Werner Herzog film “Aguirre: Wrath of God.” Much like Klaus Kinsky in that film (spoiler alert), the quest for the golden city does not end well.</p>

<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenStack Silicon Valley<!-- raw HTML omitted --> summit took place on Tuesday, and I had a blast! There were a lot of recent developments discussed at the summit, including HP’s acquisition of Eucalyptus, and I had the opportunity to meet old friends and make some new. There’s a lot that took place, so I’ll split this into two blog posts. In this first one I’ll discuss some of the recent announcements and what HP and Cisco brought to the summit. In the second part, I’ll discuss VMware and some of my overall takeaways.</p>
<p>First, as is the case in any conference, much of the value is found in the hallways. I ran into a couple of StackStorm users and advisors, a bunch of friends I knew via Nexenta, and had some great honest conversations.</p>
<p>I think my first chat post coffee (when my brain started to switch on) was with Bernard Golden from ActiveState, Stephen Spector from HP, and Jesse Proudman from Blue Box. That got me into a great mood and gives you an idea of who attended – lots and lots of thoughtful folks willing to share their perspectives.</p>
