<p>In this blog post, we cover CI part of CICD with Docker as an example. At a high level, this blog post will demonstrate how to create a docker image and push it to a registry on every commit to a github repo. You have probably read our own James Fryman’s excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on continuous delivery with StackStorm in a more traditional environment. If not, I highly recommend reading it. Also, this recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from docker is a great introduction to using docker in continuous delivery. Before diving into the details, below is some motivation for switching to container based immutable infrastructure.</p>

<p>As Michael Dehaan of Ansible fame notes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->immutable infrastructure is the way of the future<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Containers (especially, Docker) facilitate this by offering users a way to define their infrastructure through simple files (Dockerfile, for example). The role of orchestration tools changes when dealing with immutable infrastructure. A relevant quote from Michael Dehaan’s blog:</p>

<p>Time and time again, we hear of companies achieving rapid acceleration with DevOps. Companies are touting success with the metric of deploys/day, sharing new baselines of 10, 50 or even 100 deploys/day. In more mature organizations the likes of LinkedIn, Netflix, Etsy, Facebook and others, this number is a startling 1,000+ number. But, what does this even mean?</p>
<p>Unpacking this number is often one IT leaders stumble on, and is the greatest source of pushback when talking about rapid acceleration. How stable is the software being delivered? How many of these deployments are successful? What constitutes a deployment?</p>
<p>These questions and more often end up creating analysis paralysis, and nothing changes. In fact, the most common response starts with, “There is no way we could implement something like that at my company because…” We know this to be false. Companies who have traditionally delivered in a waterfall fashion with a single, bloated deploy per month or quarter are successfully transitioning to rapid deployment posting similar baseline numbers as other teams.</p>
<p>How then can you be successful in beginning software delivery? There is no single silver bullet or magic wand, but there is a fairly prescriptive methodology for achieving our goal of rapid delivery. Let’s dive in and take a look on how to get started.</p>

One of the major challenges that any organization routinely faces is managing all the complexity associated with deploying application workloads in the cloud. Once those workloads begin to leave the local data center finding some way to automate the management of the public cloud they are running on becomes a much higher priority than it ever do when those workloads were running on premise.

<p>Yesterday’s inaugural <!-- raw HTML omitted -->event-driven automation meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was informative, and a lot of fun.</p>
<p>LinkedIn did a great job of hosting and accommodating us at the last minute, as reservations exceed expectations and a larger room, more pizza, and beer were needed.</p>
<p>It was great to see friends from Netflix, HP, Facebook, Asurion, eBay, VISA and elsewhere in attendance. The questions were sharp and direct. As someone pointed out – “event-driven automation” is a relatively new space now getting tremendous attention as operators seek to compare notes on how they are boosting their operational agility through intelligent automation.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend the talks given by both Brian Sherwin and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dmitri Zimine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Brian’s talk got right into why and how LinkedIn built what they are calling Nurse. His talk was engaging and straightforward and Nurse itself is clearly extremely well thought through. Nurse has been designed to do remediations as simply as possible, with workflow and basic event handling included. While Nurse is relatively new and is being rolled out more broadly within LinkedIn, it already is handling some thousands of plans a week. It is run as a true Remediation as a Service in that the developers themselves – who are responsible for most of the ops of their code – utilize Nurse to save time and improve availability of their applications a pattern we also see frequently with StackStorm. LinkedIn has not yet open sourced Nurse; however, Brian indicated that they are interested in doing so.</p>

      <p><strong><em>StackStorm Extends Support for Users Beyond Linux / FreeBSD Servers, Provides Ability to Directly Manage and Orchestrate Windows Infrastructure</em></strong></p>
<p>PALO ALTO, Calif. — May 14, 2015 — <a href="www.stackstorm.com">StackStorm</a>, a provider of open source event-driven automation software, today announced the availability of StackStorm software as a certified solution on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Additionally, StackStorm announced that it is now offering StackStorm users the ability to wire operations automation into Windows Server and Microsoft Azure services, including Azure Virtual Machines and Azure Blob storage.</p>
<p>StackStorm’s support for these Microsoft products allows users to automate their infrastructure using event-driven automation, an approach to tying together and automating entire environments used to run some of the world’s largest environments including Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>With these integrations, users are now able to directly manage and orchestrate their Windows Server infrastructure and their Azure services using StackStorm. With StackStorm’s direct support now available, those operators can re-use all of their existing Windows PowerShell-based tooling and automation scripts. This means users can immediately start receiving the value and benefits of StackStorm event driven automation without incurring additional overhead. Because many new automation tools don’t embrace the re-use of existing tools and scripts, this forces development teams to incur huge costs in terms of time, resources, porting scripts and existing infrastructure to new tools.</p>
