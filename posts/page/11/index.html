        2.1 is Coming to Town: Check the New Pack Management

<p>Dear stormers and friends!</p>
<p>We are almost ready with a new and quite exciting platform release. This is a big release and we are really looking forward to it, and you should, too – just check out <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org">exchange.stackstorm.org</a> to get excited about what is coming. As usual, you will soon see an announcement, a blog describing the highlights of what we’ve done, and a back-story on how and why we did it.</p>
<p>This, however, is an unusual “head’s up”. The changes around pack management we are introducing in 2.1 are so substantial that it’s fair to give you time to review the new features, read the <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">changelog</a>, and adjust your private packs or automation around StackStorm if needed. We’re inviting you to contribute – EASILY – by trying out the new functionality and sharing feedback, or helping us catch last-minute bugs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/reference/packmgmt.html">transition notes are drafted here</a>. The full list of changes is <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">in the change log</a>. Please help us improve the docs wherever you find them unclear, confusing or imprecise – we are actively testing as we write this.</p>
<p>The biggest change is introducing <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. All integration packs from st2contrib, as well as other packs scattered around, are being moved under <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. Once the transfer is complete, you will be submitting your new packs as PRs against <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator">StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator</a> repo, as described in <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator/README.md">README.md</a>. Making features and fixes on existing community packs will be much easier now that each pack is in it’s own GitHub repo.</p>

<p>The DevOps movement is focused on leading transformational change and driving innovation. At the recent DevOps Enterprise Summit in San Francisco, many of the leaders in the field spoke of driving change through a culture focused on collaboration, community, co-creation, curiosity, continual learning, designing for joy, and meaningful work. I have been impressed with the passion and conviction that leaders in the DevOps movement speak about and emphasize these key principles.. Through determination and focus, living out these key values, and recognizing that everyone has a role to play—we will be able to truly unlock the power of technology to address the many complex global challenges we face today.</p>
<p>An excellent example of leveraging DevOps and technology to address complex global challenges is found in the field of Genomics Research. Through focus on the values spoken about by DevOps thought leaders and innovation at the speed of community—Science, Universities, Government, and Business, powered by advances in IT, are able to join forces to develop and evolve techniques that allow for the reading of the source code of biology—something that is incredibly complex and in parts extremely optimized. Through this important work, we are just beginning to unlock the secrets and miraculous mysteries to life on earth as we know it.</p>

<p>The pattern is the same: “I can’t because we don’t…”, “But we are also…”, “Can I …”, and finally “How do I get it?”</p>
<p>We’re demonstrating Brocade Workflow Composer (BWC), powered by <a href="http://stackstorm.com">StackStorm</a>, at <a href="http://www.brocade.com/en/about-us/events/sc16.html">SuperComputing16</a> in Salt Lake City. When you stop by booth 1131, we will give you a token of our appreciation. It’s an NodeMCU microcontroller. It’s pretty cool – WiFi built in, ARM microcontroller, lots of GPIO pins, and it can easily be programmed using the freely-available Arduino IDE. It gets you into the world of IoT quickly and easily, and it’s a lot of fun! Bonus!</p>
<p>But there is a catch – you have to watch a demo to get it.</p>

<p>Lights flashing at the StackStorm-Brocade booth made event-driven automation feel real with the IoT demo entertaining enterprise and DevOps crowds alike. Mirantis’ talk about auto-healing Symantec OpenStack cloud with StackStorm sparkled hallway conversations about auto-remediation. Our guerrilla hacking challenge was success, unveiled that the best hackers are all co-located…(guess where, anyone?)</p>

<p>To be a good Stormer is to be a good hacker. Not necessarily in the sense that you enjoy compromising unsuspecting grandmother’s laptop or a random web cam, but that you have a curiosity about how things work. This isn’t unique in the tech industry at large, and many security conferences exploit this curiosity for fun in the form of Capture The Flag (CTF) type problem solver games and various challenges. This year for OpenStack Summit we’ve built our own challenge for people to play. The main reason is because it’s just plain fun, but we also think it’s a great way to introduce people to the power of StackStorm. If you’re bent towards curiosity and if you are a hacker at heart, read on!</p>
