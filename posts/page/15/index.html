<em>by Dmitri Zimine</em></p>
<p>Fellow automators, we are happy to announce StackStorm 1.3. In this “Holiday release” (yes most of the work took place around the holidays) we took a break from “big features” and focused on addressing key learnings from extensive field usage, turning feedback from our expert users, and our own take aways from internal StackStorm use, into practical product improvements. The highlight of the release is a long-awaited ability to restart a workflow from a point of failure. We have been pushing it through for quite a while, first in upstream OpenStack Mistral, than exposing it via StackStorm, and now it’s ready for the prime time. With other highlights – making it easier to debug rules, track complex automation executions, and keep the history size under control – 1.3 release is a major step up in making StackStorm performant, operational and convenient.</p>
<p>Read on to learn about release highlights and what is coming up next. To upgrade, <a href=https://stackstorm.reamaze.com/kb/installation/upgrade-from-v1-dot-2-to-v1-dot-3>follow this KB</a>.</p>

Unifying disparate applications into the One System

<p><em>Originally published at <a href=http://devops.com/2016/01/29/unifying-applications-into-one-system>http://devops.com/2016/01/29/unifying-applications-into-one-system</a></em></p>
<p>Let’s talk about a real problem that all of us have faced at one point or another: keeping track of a single thread of work across many disparate tools. Regardless of the specific industry a company operates in, as a company grows, back-office applications in support of the business begin to accumulate. Many knowledge based companies have some sort of communication tool, some sort of project tracker, and some support tracker. These are tools that aim at being more effective with daily business process. Conversations suffice until they do not, and tools are implemented as the need arises. Every tool that was added has purpose, solves a critical need, and made you and/or your team more productive.</p>
<p>At some point however, this changes. Discovery starts to become a major issue as usage patterns between different tools leaves solos of data. It becomes hard to correlate the different company pipelines that ultimately drive your business: the pipeline to care and communicate for customers, the pipeline to deliver new features, and the human interfaces involved in each. This is only intensified by team members that work on different project with different tools and people, you introduce team members from a timezone not your own, the sheer quantity of work… how many ways can you name how not just conversations are lost, but <em>context</em></p>

<p>Happy Monday! In today’s StackStorm quick tip, we are going to show you a way to rapidly test and deploy packs. This technique pairs a StackStorm action, <a href=https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/blob/master/contrib/packs/actions/install.meta.yaml><code>packs.install</code></a>, and an <a href=https://docs.stackstorm.com/chatops/aliases.html>Action-Alias</a> that we will create to allow users to rapidly test and deploy new ChatOps commands for themselves.</p>

StackStorm and ChatOps Actions with confirmation

<p>Before moving to Openstack integration I’d like to post a short article about highly demanded feature, which is going to be implemented and supported natively out of the box by StackStorm one day, – Chatops Action Confirmation.</p>
<p>In short, some actions, requested from chatops, may indeed be dangerous and typo errors or incorrectly entered values may harm your system or lead to unexpected, unpredictable and undesirable results. That being said, it would be really nice to ask the user who issued the command to confirm his or her intentions to execute it.</p>
<p>So for now we have to do it on our own. And I’ll tell you what – it is not really difficult. We will examine two chatops aliases and I will elucidate on the things happening under the hood when these aliases are triggered.</p>

Stackstorm: from Nagios integration to Openstack automation
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
<p><strong>January 07, 2016</strong><br>
<em>by Igor Cherkaev aka eMptywee</em></p>
<p>Recently I’ve been playing around Stackstorm – a platform for integration and automation of day-to-day tasks, monitoring events, existing scripts and deployment tools.</p>
<p>I am going to explain how easy it is to wrap your daily tasks into Stackstorm actions and workflows and how to provide a simple way of execution for complex tasks.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking for a while and initially I was going to bring everything up in one blog post. But later, it didn’t seem like a good idea. That being said, I’d rather break it into multiple posts, no matter how many there would be. Anyway, it seems to me that it’d be more practical and easier to read and understand.</p>
<h2 id=nagios>Nagios</h2>
<p>Let’s start with integrating Nagios alerts into Stackstorm. Assuming that you already have Stackstorm version 1.2.0+ installed, configured and running, as well as there’s Nagios running somewhere else that is capable of processing alerts and handling events. If not, please, proceed to &lt;www.stackstorm.com> and &lt;www.nagios.org> (installation and initial configuration of these two tools is beyond the scope of this post). Both tools are open source and free to use and have extensive documentation on installation and basic configuration.</p>
<p>First of all, I was happy to find an existing Nagios integration pack <a href=https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-nagios>on StackStorm community repo</a>, but my joy ended really quickly as I found it not working. Secondly, <a href=https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/05/auto-remediation-out-of-disk-space/>this StackStorm tutorial</a> helped me to get started.</p>

StackStorm 1.2 release announcement

<p><strong>December 8, 2015</strong><br>
<em>by Manas Kelshikar</em></p>
<p>The holidays are upon us and we decided to celebrate with our v1.2.0 release of StackStorm! StackStorm v1.2.0 follows up as an update to our blockbuster <a href=https://stackstorm.com/2015/11/02/stackstorm-v1-is-out/>v1.1.0</a>.</p>
<p>StackStorm 1.2 features significant changes to ChatOps, some smaller improvements and plenty of bug fixes. Lets walk through some of the highlights –</p>
<h2 id=chatops>ChatOps</h2>
<p>The ChatOps changes are so extensive that we decided to dedicate a separate blog <a href=https://stackstorm.com/2015/12/08/stackstorm-1-2-0-the-new-chatops/>here</a>. Once users familiarized themselves with StackStorm-powered ChatOps we received excellent feedback which has been translated into some of the improvements in this release.</p>
<p>The major theme is extending further your control of your ChatOps and especially what is presented in your precious chat real-estate.  We commercially support ChatOps – and we think improve it greatly versus rolling your own flavor of a bot or directly connecting more and more integrations to chat.</p>
<p>While we were at it we also took the liberty of reworking some StackStorm internals to better suit ChatOps needs thus enabling some of the features and opening up the door for many more future improvements.</p>
