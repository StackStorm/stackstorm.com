<p>Time flies when you’re having fun, or better yet, when you’re shipping new features! We are pleased to announce for general release version 0.8 of StackStorm, our biggest release to date! This version contains a ton of platform improvements, user feature requests, new packs and much more.</p>
<h6 id=features>FEATURES</h6>
<p><strong>Web UI</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s right! We are pleased to announce our inaugural release of the StackStorm Web UI.  We have had the UI in a limited beta release for about 2 months now, and have been responding to feedback as it comes in. This is easily one of our more common user requests, so we’re excited that it’s now ready to start sharing with the world.</p>
<p>With the brand new UI, we now have three views to consume: Actions, History, and Rules.</p>

4 Ways To Break Through The Barriers To DevOps Adoption
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
<p><strong>February 18, 2015</strong></p>
<p><em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p><em>This post originally appeared on VentureBeat.</em></p>
<p>DevOps is hot. Google Trends confirms that awareness of the term has exploded over the last eighteen months, and DevOps gurus like Gene Kim and Patrick Dubois — who is credited with coining the term DevOps — are becoming even more widely read and consulted by a range of companies. Even so-called “legacy” companies, such as Target, Ford, and Johnson and Johnson are embracing and experimenting with DevOps.</p>
<p>And yet, as discussed in my last article, the barriers to enterprises achieving the kind of productivity boost that DevOps adoption promises are considerable and often non-obvious. These non-obvious barriers have confounded even the companies now acknowledged as the most productive creators and operators of software in history: companies like Facebook, eBay/PayPal, Amazon Web Services, Apple, and others.</p>
<p>How have the most successful operators overcome the barriers to DevOps adoption and achieved the sort of 10-20x, or even 50x boosts in agility, that have allowed them to innovate at a higher level than competitors and even change the world?</p>

[Press Release] StackStorm To Present On Barriers And Best Practices For DevOps At SCALE 13x

<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
<p><strong>February 17, 2015</strong></p>
<p>PALO ALTO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–StackStorm, a provider of event-driven automation software, today announced it will present on “DevOps Day 2: People and Processes” in the La Jolla Room at the Hilton Los Angeles Airport during SCALE 13x on February 20. James Fryman of StackStorm, previously at GitHub, will discuss challenges and best practices for doing DevOps successfully.</p>
<p>StackStorm will also be at booth #76 throughout the conference and is sponsoring the SCALE 13x DevOps Day track.</p>
<p>“DevOps is now seen as a competitive weapon across many industries, as software ‘eats everything,’” said Fryman. “Doing DevOps successfully involves a shift in company culture and more. I’m looking forward to discussing ways we see the incredible customer responsiveness promised by DevOps actually being achieved through culture change, tooling, workflow collaboration, ChatOps and more. We will also touch on some all too common anti-patterns.”</p>
