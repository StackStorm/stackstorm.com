<h4 id="team-organization">​TEAM ORGANIZATION</h4>
<p>​Many organizations have recognized that a DevOps-like organization of teams is needed. How do you get started down this path, and what are the metrics needed in order to manage this transition? StackStorm will engage with you 1:1 to assist in this transition. We have written extensively about these transitions in our blog and in publications such as DevOps.com, VentureBeat, OpenSource.com and elsewhere.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h4 id="tools-selection">​TOOLS SELECTION</h4>
<p>​More and more tools are being developed and released, joining an already crowded enterprise data center. If you are selecting “infrastructure as code” friendly tools like configuration management, should you pick widely deployed Puppet or perhaps the new kids on the block Ansible or Salt? Similarly, what about MoogSoft vs. SignalFX or even Sensu and Nagios? What will be best for your projects and for your organization? StackStorm can help you navigate this path.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h4 id="scope-definition">​SCOPE DEFINITION</h4>
<p>​One of the surest ways to achieve success in your transition to DevOps is to pick a project and achieve stunning success.Conversely, if you try to up your organization’s operational agility by 10x in one project, you are liable to be disappointed. StackStorm can help define the right scope for your company’s project.</p>
