The 2020 ChatOps User Survey is here! This is your chance to submit your feedback on using ChatOps with StackStorm – what we get right, what we get wrong, and what we need to focus on.
We will use this feedback to chart the development roadmap for ChatOps, whether that means leaving st2chatops as-is, or focusing on supporting more chat providers, deeper feature support for specific providers, improving ChatOps integration with the rest of StackStorm (RBAC for ChatOps!

After acquiring the StackStorm product and the amazing StackStorm team in 2017 from Brocade, Extreme Networks has been a large contributor (if not the largest contributor) to the StackStorm project, even donating the code and transferring the StackStorm trademarks to the Linux Foundation last year. Continuing that tradition, Extreme Networks announced today that they were donated their enterprise extensions of StackStorm (previously StackStorm Enterprise) to the Linux Foundation!

<p>It happened! 🎉 After a long wait, we’re more than excited to announce the StackStorm <code>v3.2.0</code> release.</p>
<p>The StackStorm project has had some turbulent times since the previous release almost one year ago. The new v3.2.0 version is the first release since the project <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2019/10/07/stackstorm-joins-the-linux-foundation/">joined the Linux Foundation</a>, formed new <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2020/02/20/stackstorm-governance-and-maintainers/">Governance</a>, and gathered a new team of <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/blob/master/OWNERS.md">Maintainers</a>. Considering the amount of changes happened, it looks like a big restart for the project.</p>
<p>It’s awesome for StackStorm to be under new governance. But that also means everything is on the Community’s shoulders now. And while it’s harder to rely only on the community’s efforts compared to the previously dedicated team of full-time employees, these days we’re observing increased number of contributors and interest from the larger organizations to adopt StackStorm Event Driven Automation and Automated Remediation. We hope this trend continues and we are striving for a better project future and further growth, together.</p>
<p>So what’s new in StackStorm 3.2.0?<br>
This version aggregated almost one hundred changes including bugfixes, new <a href="#pack-dependencies">Pack Dependencies</a>, <a href="#rhel-8-centos-8-support">RHEL 8 / CentOS 8 Support</a>, Orquesta <a href="#orquesta-retry">retry</a> and <a href="#orquesta-re-run">re-run</a> features, <a href="#chatops-refactoring">ChatOps updates</a>, <a href="#chatops-immutable-parameters">Immutable parameters in Action Aliases</a>, performance improvements, and more.</p>

<p>The agility at which the business can respond to real-life situations is proportional to the level of digitization that has been implemented in the business. For a business to nimble and agile, it is imperative that all the processes be delivered as a digital service that can be provisioned, monitored and remediated by an automation logic at the core of the business. The automation logic should follow the <a href="https://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/glossary/m/mape_loop.html">Monitor, Assess, Plan and Execute (MAPE) loop</a> methodology to provide a complete closed-loop automation system for the digital business.

<p>More groups are progressing from just talking about Event-Driven Automation to actually doing it in practice. StackStorm helps make this easy. When organizations start offloading business-critical tasks and automating for real it becomes essential to ensure that the Automation engine itself is not a single point of failure when it is responsible for recovering a fleet of servers, managing datacenters, and automating remediations.</p>
<p>StackStorm was designed to be cloud-native, API-driven, easily deployed, microservice-oriented, resilient and can be scaled out horizontally to fulfill High Availability and/or High Load demands.</p>
<p>Previously we only documented best practices describing how to distribute StackStorm in HA mode (<a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html">docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html</a>), giving a high level overview regarding StackStorm design and how to ensure its redundancy. Based on those recommendations, some companies were spending weeks to months to codify a complex st2 HA infrastructure and iterate over their deployments until finding that “silver bullet” stability/production state.</p>

<p>Ready to automatically provision and maintain StackStorm nodes in production? Then the <code>stackstorm-st2</code> Puppet module is for you! We’re proud to announce the <code>v1.0.0</code> stable release of <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2</a>, the StackStorm Puppet module.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/puppet-st2"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Puppet is an excellent tool that allows the user to declare the desired state of their system in code. Once defined, hand over the reins to Puppet and watch as it transforms your nodes into what you’ve declared. We wanted to bring the power of declarative state to StackStorm deployments, and <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">puppet-st2</a> is that solution.</p>

<p>A great deal of work has gone into the <code>v1.0.0</code> release to ensure that <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/install/puppet.html">st2 Puppet Module</a> is ready to provision and manage StackStorm nodes in production environments. See January, 2018 <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2018/01/05/announcing-puppet-module-1-0-0-rc/">Puppet Module to Install StackStorm – Announcing Release Candidate</a>. Over the past year we’ve iterated through several pre-releases, release-candidate versions, fixed a lot of bugs, reworked the entire module structure and can now declare it stable and production ready.</p>

<p>So far StackStorm has multiple installation methods: deb/rpm packages, <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/index.html#ref-one-line-install"><code>curl|bash</code></a> installer used for simple deployments, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2-docker">Docker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/chef-stackstorm">Chef</a>.</p>
<p>Now it’s Puppet time!</p>
<p>Starting in July of 2017 a major effort has been underway to modernize the Puppet module to install/deploy StackStorm. In August of 2017 <code>v1.0.0-beta</code> was released with completely re-worked internals to support the new StackStorm <code>deb/rpm</code> package installation method and fix a large number of bugs. Since the beta we’ve continued development of new features like supporting all 4 StackStorm OSes, Puppet 4 and 5 compatibility, ChatOps installation and configuration, modernized pack management, full integration testing in Docker containers along with a slew of Puppet best practices improvements.</p>
<p>Today we’re proud to announce the Release Candidate version <code>v1.0.0-rc</code> of the <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2"><code>stackstorm-st2</code></a> Puppet module which is available on Forge.<br>
<a href="https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2"><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2<br>
</a><br>
Our plan is to release <code>v1.0.0</code> stable in the coming weeks, but in order to do this we need your help. We ask everyone who is interested in Puppet-based deployment to give the module a try and provide your feedback!</p>

<p><a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange</a> is an open source catalog of reusable actions. Integrations with everything ranging from common-man DevOps tools, suit and tie services like ServiceNow and Remedy to cool kids like Slack or Twilio, to more exotic systems like HUE Lights and Tesla cars. At the time of writing, there are 6500+ actions spread across 130 integration packs. It is Open Source, with a great community of maintainers. Something that makes StackStorm a great wiring tool to build automations integrating a wide breadth of domains.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But if you’ve taken a red pill and gone wholesale on AWS running serverless, deploying <a href="https://stackstorm.com/">StackStorm</a> may be not an option. Yet the catalog of reusable functions to integrate with commonly used services is an appealing idea. C’mon there should be 1000 Slack lambdas and 10,000 Twilio lambdas out there already, it doesn’t feel creative to write 10,001? Jealous to Azure with their <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/apis-list#popular-connectors">great library of reusable connectors</a>? Why can’t YOU grab something ready-to-use?</p>
<p>Now you can! Run StackStorm Exchange actions as lambda functions. Without StackStorm. <strong>Serverless and Stormless.</strong></p>

<p>Site Reliability Engineering is very much the natural evolution of the trusted system administrator and most would agree the SRE role embodies the core principles of DevOps. Google consider these people consultative and of huge value. Software for the masses has changed from monolithic monsters to complex architectures, driving the adoption of new skill sets required for system administrators to evolve to an SRE. It’s no longer about restarting large services at 3am; it’s about keeping the cattle alive and producing milk, whilst at the same time ensuring that the machinery is understood and utilised correctly. This could mean writing custom components to help with performance, availability, telemetry, reporting, managing workloads and dealing with alerts etc. For this gathering of SREs, Usenix chose the location and venue well. Ireland is a techhub for many start-ups and established organisations, most if not all have SREs under employment. Some 600+ people were booked in to the event, with huge attendance from the likes of Demonware, Facebook, Google and Indeed. Many smaller organisations and individuals were also in attendance to gain from the experience of others.</p>

<p>In this blog, we show how to scale out a Docker Swarm Cluster based on container workload, so that you don’t over-provision your AWS cluster and pay for just enough instances to run your containers. Learn how we achieved this, watch the <em>2 min video</em> to see it in action. Read the blog for details.

<p>If you’ve been paying attention to the news around new StackStorm integrations, you may have noticed the <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-exchange/stackstorm-napalm">NAPALM pack</a> was created a few weeks ago. For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm">NAPALM</a>, it’s a Python library that provides a <strong>multi-vendor</strong> abstraction layer for interacting with network devices like routers and switches (for those not working in the network industry, you can think of NAPALM as “libcloud” for your network).  This is really useful for doing network automation, because it means you only need to write a script (or a StackStorm action) once, targeting this library, and it’s immediately usable against the 10+ network vendors supported by NAPALM (a list that is growing all the time).</p>

<p>StackStorm was proud to once again exhibit at SREcon this year in San Francisco. If you haven’t attended SREcon before, there’s really no better place to get in touch with so many SRE professionals that are pushing the envelope and redefining what it means to run a modern operations team.</p>
<p>This year, we brought a quite nifty, flashy demonstration that one of our core developers Matt Stone put together, involving Raspberry Pis, LEDs, and – of course – StackStorm!

<p>The majority of StackStorm packs are created and submitted by our community. While we do code reviews and give advice, it is our users that helped us reach over 100 integrations.</p>
<p>But a lot of people do not just stop there. Even after submitting packs, they are continuously putting effort into keeping the codebase up to date, reviewing contributions, and helping others. This effort does not go unnoticed—and in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent post about StackStorm Exchange<!-- raw HTML omitted --> we have announced that we will be granting pack maintainers full collaboration rights in the Exchange repositories. We are happy to introduce the first maintainers, together covering around 20 packs.</p>

<p>Hey, it’s Dmitri here, back from <a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/15x/">Scale15x</a> with a short report of what I enjoyed the most.</p>
<p><strong>My talk 🙂</strong> It was a bit symbolic for me. I spoke at <a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/openstack-vs-vmware-systems-administrator-perspective.html">Scale13x</a>, comparing and contrasting Enterprise Suites and OpenSource, and stated the free pillars of “Designed for DevOps”:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenSource</li>
<li>Infrastructure as code</li>
<li>Social coding and collaboration</li>
</ul>
<p>In my talk this time, I reported back on how we put these three principles in practice with StackStorm, redefining Runbook automation for the time of clouds and Devops. The core of the talk was a live demo of StackStorm, auto-remediation, and ChatOps. Thank you who came for my talk on this late Sunday afternoon and gave me warm welcome and great questions. For the rest, here are the <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DmitriZimine/stackstrom-ifthisthanthat-for-devops-automation">the slides</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/3TjhBGshvvY?t=3h31m5s">the video recording</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Want to install StackStorm on a machine that doesn’t have access to the internet? If you’ve got another box on your local network that connects to the public network, you can do this by making it a local package repository server. In this post, we’ll walk you through steps for setting up an apt-mirror server with the required packages and configuring the <strong>offline</strong> client machine to quickly get a full StackStorm installation up and running!</p>

<p>A little while ago we <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/12/06/2-1-new-pack-management/">rolled out StackStorm 2.1</a>, a release focused on one primary theme: integration packs.</p>
<p>StackStorm pack management infrastructure is evolving with the demand. As the number of integration packs grows, we want to provide means for faster and easier deployment, make pack development more productive, and encourage collaboration. There are dozens of changes making it happen—both in our internal infrastructure and the StackStorm core—and we are excited and hopeful that through better experience with integration packs, working with StackStorm will become even more efficient, easy, and fun.</p>
<p>As it is the case with all “thematic” releases, 2.1 is more than just a set of features and changes. It has a lot of context around it, and more importantly, it has a story—and this is a story we are now going to tell.</p>

So if you’re using the Elastic Stack, and are looking to automate event remediation in your environment, you’re at the right place!

Just in case you missed it, we published StackStorm v2.1.1 late last week. This is a minor update, on top of the major changes to pack management we made with 2.1.
There’s a few small bugfixes and enhancements:
 core.http now supports HTTP basic auth and digest authentication. Local action runner supports unicode parameter keys and values. Improved error handling and more user-friendly messages for packs commands and APIs.

<p>Dear stormers and friends!</p>
<p>We are almost ready with a new and quite exciting platform release. This is a big release and we are really looking forward to it, and you should, too – just check out <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org">exchange.stackstorm.org</a> to get excited about what is coming. As usual, you will soon see an announcement, a blog describing the highlights of what we’ve done, and a back-story on how and why we did it.</p>
<p>This, however, is an unusual “head’s up”. The changes around pack management we are introducing in 2.1 are so substantial that it’s fair to give you time to review the new features, read the <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">changelog</a>, and adjust your private packs or automation around StackStorm if needed. We’re inviting you to contribute – EASILY – by trying out the new functionality and sharing feedback, or helping us catch last-minute bugs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/reference/packmgmt.html">transition notes are drafted here</a>. The full list of changes is <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">in the change log</a>. Please help us improve the docs wherever you find them unclear, confusing or imprecise – we are actively testing as we write this.</p>
<p>The biggest change is introducing <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. All integration packs from st2contrib, as well as other packs scattered around, are being moved under <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. Once the transfer is complete, you will be submitting your new packs as PRs against <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator">StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator</a> repo, as described in <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator/README.md">README.md</a>. Making features and fixes on existing community packs will be much easier now that each pack is in it’s own GitHub repo.</p>

<p>The DevOps movement is focused on leading transformational change and driving innovation. At the recent DevOps Enterprise Summit in San Francisco, many of the leaders in the field spoke of driving change through a culture focused on collaboration, community, co-creation, curiosity, continual learning, designing for joy, and meaningful work. I have been impressed with the passion and conviction that leaders in the DevOps movement speak about and emphasize these key principles.. Through determination and focus, living out these key values, and recognizing that everyone has a role to play—we will be able to truly unlock the power of technology to address the many complex global challenges we face today.</p>
<p>An excellent example of leveraging DevOps and technology to address complex global challenges is found in the field of Genomics Research. Through focus on the values spoken about by DevOps thought leaders and innovation at the speed of community—Science, Universities, Government, and Business, powered by advances in IT, are able to join forces to develop and evolve techniques that allow for the reading of the source code of biology—something that is incredibly complex and in parts extremely optimized. Through this important work, we are just beginning to unlock the secrets and miraculous mysteries to life on earth as we know it.</p>

When you stop by booth 1131, we will give you a token of our appreciation. It’s an NodeMCU microcontroller. It’s pretty cool – WiFi built in, ARM microcontroller, lots of GPIO pins, and it can easily be programmed using the freely-available Arduino IDE. It gets you into the world of IoT quickly and easily, and it’s a lot of fun! Bonus!</p>

<p>To be a good Stormer is to be a good hacker. Not necessarily in the sense that you enjoy compromising unsuspecting grandmother’s laptop or a random web cam, but that you have a curiosity about how things work. This isn’t unique in the tech industry at large, and many security conferences exploit this curiosity for fun in the form of Capture The Flag (CTF) type problem solver games and various challenges. This year for OpenStack Summit we’ve built our own challenge for people to play. The main reason is because it’s just plain fun, but we also think it’s a great way to introduce people to the power of StackStorm. If you’re bent towards curiosity and if you are a hacker at heart, read on!</p>

<p>Hey folks, StackStorm v2.0.1 has been released, with a few small fixes and enhancements. We’ve also had some great code contributions recently, with a new integration for <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>, and improvements to our Github and Nagios packs.</p>

        How to Troubleshoot a Rule

<p>I set up a sensor to watch for a trigger (trigger represents an external event; sensor will fire a trigger-instance of the trigger type when the event is detected). I created a rule: if the trigger happens, and matches the criteria, it should fire an action. I see that event had happened. I expected the actions to fire. But it didn’t happen. Where did it break?</p>
<p>This is a long read, and may look complicated. But really, it’s just <em>three debugging steps</em>. And it’s long because I refuse to write briefly, drop bunch of hints on the way and get you distracted. But as they say in math, the thicker the math book the faster it reads. <strong>Brace yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>In the example below, I’ll be showing you how we debugged our Twitter automation that scans tweets for mentions and posts it to Slack. A pretty good way to keep track on who is trash talking about us! The debugging “runbook” is generic and applies to troubleshooting other rules just fine.</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the trigger chain and review how it works.</p>

<p>I’ve seen it over and over again.</p>
<p>A user puts in a simple request. Nothing elaborate or unusual – just a standard request. It goes into the queue, generates a ticket, and then… nothing.</p>
<p>Days or weeks later, an overworked, tired engineer in the back office operations room finally gets to the request, opens a process document, and begins the laborious task of doing the same thing that he or she has done dozens of times before each time that this type of request comes in. Ok, maybe the IP address or the user name has changed, but the process is the same as it has always been. And it is slow. Very slow. And the engineer may make a mistake. And, quite frankly, it’s frustrating for the user and boring for the engineer.</p>

<p>This feature comes handy in situations where multiple users request the same action, but the action is already running because of the first request.</p>

<p>We love our users. We love them even when they report bugs. We love them <strong>because</strong> they report bugs. But we <strong>really, really</strong> love our users when they report bugs, along with complete configurations, how to reproduce the bug, and logs. Recently <a href="https://github.com/bri365">Brian Martin</a> did just this, helping us resolve a tricky deadlock bug. Thank you Brian!</p>
<h2 id="tracking-down-deadlocks">Tracking down Deadlocks</h2>
<p>When you’re investigating a bug report, the first thing you want to do is to try to reproduce it. This helps you see what’s going on, and it gives you a clear test case to see if you’ve resolved it. Deadlocks &amp; race conditions can be horrible bugs to work with, as they are often difficult to reproduce. They might depend upon your hardware resources, or what other jobs are running at the same time. Even reproducing it on the exact same setup is tough.</p>

Today we are happy to announce the release of StackStorm v1.5.1.
This is primarily a bug-fix release which includes bug fixes and improvements for some of the features which have been introduced in StackStorm v1.5.0.
Release Highlights  Fix trigger registration when using st2-register-content script with –register-triggers flag. Fix an issue with CronTimer sometimes not firing due to TriggerInstance creation failure. Add support for default values when a new pack configuration is used.

      <p>The StackStorm documentation is pretty good. But it’s not always enough. Sometimes you need a bit of help. Sometimes you think you’ve found a bug, and want to talk with the developers about it. That’s where our StackStorm community support can help.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve heard us talk about our <a href="http://stackstorm.com/community-signup">Slack channel</a>. It’s a great place for StackStorm users to get together, share ideas, and solve problems. But did you know that our Stormers are in this channel, and do their best to help support the community?</p>
<p>Our engineers hang out here from 9:00 -&gt; 17:00 PST, and often later. They’re happy to answer whatever questions you have. Just in the last few days, we’ve had questions about installation, ChatOps setup, writing sensors, purging history, creating actions, etc. Because the core engineers are involved in those discussions, not only can they help fix problems, they can also explain the design thinking.</p>

<p>The last couple of months, since the <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/03/29/stackstorm-joining-brocade/">Brocade acquisition</a>, have been pretty busy for us here at StackStorm. We have been getting to know our new friends at Brocade, learning the typical networking use-cases and figuring out how we can use StackStorm to automate them and bring all the DevOps and data-center automation goodness to the networking space, while keeping StackStorm a generic DevOps automation platform.</p>
<p>As always, we have continued to support our users and the community. We also haven’t been slacking with the StackStorm feature development and improvements. We have worked hard to bring you two new releases in the last 2 months – <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/04/20/stackstorm-v1-4/">StackStorm v1.4</a> and <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">StackStorm v1.5</a>.</p>
<p>StackStorm v1.5 which has been released just recently includes many new features and improvements so if you haven’t already, I would encourage you to go <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Today I will talk about the one of the major new features in StackStorm v1.5 which has been <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/2542">discussed and requested many times in the past</a> already. That is improved pack configuration.</p>

<p><strong>StackStorm v1.5.0</strong> has been released! More features, more improvements, and more bugfixes (sorry about those). Read on to hear about the changes, or fire up <code>apt</code>/<code>yum</code> and upgrade!</p>
<h2 id="cli-completion">CLI Completion!</h2>
<p>Spend a lot of your time using the <code>st2</code> CLI? You’ll love this change: We’ve added CLI auto-completion to the <code>st2</code> command. Type <code>st2</code> then hit tab twice. You’ll get a list of all available arguments. This works multiple levels deep. Very handy when you can’t quite remember the right syntax:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Simple, but cool.</p>
<h2 id="datastore-secrets-and-user-scoping">Datastore Secrets and User-Scoping</h2>
<p>The StackStorm datastore service allows you to store common parameters and their values for reuse within sensors, actions and rules. Prior to v1.5, these were available to all users. Now you can scope variables to a specific user, and you can control who can read or write into those variables. By default, variables are stored in the <code>system</code> scope, but you can scope it to a specific user by adding <code>--scope=user</code>, e.g.:</p>
<p><code>st2 key set date_cmd &quot;date -u&quot; --scope=user</code></p>

<p>ChatOps has been a key part of StackStorm from the outset. Even before 1.0, our first public release, you could execute any action or workflow from your chat window and get a bunch of text in response. Like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aJCOKC9.png" alt=""><br>
<em>StackStorm 1.0, September 2015</em></p>
<p>Last September (even less than a year ago, to think about it) ChatOps as a defined collaboration model was still relatively new, and the ability to execute a StackStorm action or workflow from chat was enough to excite early adopters. You could make basic workflows and routine actions work, and it made your job a little easier while keeping your teammates in the loop. However, when you wanted to read and share the output, a dumped Python object as a response wasn’t ideal.</p>

<p>What is StackStorm going to do with network automation? Ever since we joined Brocade, it’s been everyone’s question, and we have been hand-waving some answers. But the talk walks, code talks: let’s show something really working. Today’s example is on Docker network automation, where StackStorm makes physical networking follow Docker containers as they get created.</p>
<p>Millennial kids should watch my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9G71Ow6GUs">video with detailed explanations on StackStorm’s YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>True hackers might jump straight to <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/dockernetwork-vdx-demo">automation code on GitHub</a> to see how it is built and try it out on your StackStorm instance.</p>

<p>Software is not done unless it is shipped to users and they can play around with something Tangible. For a feature or bug fix to be meaningful, the interested party has to get their hands on it, and decide if the new piece of code improves their life or reduces their pain. In this blog, I am going to tell you a fascinating story of us trying to ship a set of micro services to our customers, how we learnt from our initial mistakes and then describe our new approach to make you and us happier.</p>
<p>The reason I am writing this particular blog post is twofold. I want:</p>

<li>fellow nerds to learn from our experience and replicate our success, bypassing our initial mistakes, and</li>

<p>StackStorm now installs with native linux packages. AIO will continue work for 1.3, but is no longer supported from v1.4 on. How is this good? Read on.</p>
<h3 id="welcome-new-packages">Welcome new packages</h3>
<p><a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/04/20/stackstorm-v1-4/">StackStorm 1.4 is out</a>. It comes <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/changelog.html#april-18-2016">packed with exciting features, bug fixes and improvements</a>, but the highlight of this release is the standard linux package based installation. From 1.4 this is the way to deploy StackStorm. And it is quite good.</p>

        The Brief History of ChatOps at StackStorm (and How We Got Here)

<p>These days ChatOps has become all the rage. In this blog I’ll talk a little bit about how we came to be here – in a leading position when it comes to ChatOps adoption for operations. And I’ll point you to some resources from users and our own engineers to learn more.</p>
<p>The history lesson will be brief, I promise.</p>
<p>We started StackStorm after observing that existing solutions in the devops universe were generally point solutions, often evolved from scripts and other projects that DevOps engineers wrote to make their own lives easier. And that’s a great way to build a solution that appeals at least to those types of users for those specific use cases.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What we saw was that while there were leaders within certain segments amongst those tools, there was no clearly adopted pattern for the wiring that tied all these tools together. Moreover, with our backgrounds in enterprises we knew that wiring together extremely heterogeneous environments is always a challenge. The enterprise is more a brownfield than a greenfield.</p>
<p>A quick shout out to teams at Facebook and at WebEx Spark and all those other early interviewees that taught us so much about event driven automation. And if you want to join a non commercial Bay Area meet-up about the subject and hear speakers from organizations like Facebook and LinkedIn and Netflix, please join here:<br>

<p>In the post <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm QuickTip: ChatOps your pack dev workflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> James Fryman gave a ChatOPS alias recipe to reduce the friction for deploying packs and then in the <em>Random Thoughts</em> section asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This action is tied directly to the <code>packs.install</code>. What about a workflow? Seems like that would be a better way to structure this.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonated with me as I had already started working on an internal pack that did just that, as I thought attempting to deploy a pack via an alias (and action) contained within the same pack would be madness (or just lead to interesting race conditions). In the last week, our <em>Pull Request</em> has been merged, documentation has been included in st2docs (<a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/chatops/pack_deploy.html">link</a>) for a workflow that fulfils the above random thought and should be released with 1.4.</p>
<p>So introducing <code>packs.deploy</code>, an action written in Mistral to handle the mapping of names for Git repositories to the information required to carry out the <code>packs.install</code> action.</p>

<p>Less than a week ago Microsoft announced a plan to activate Yammer — its corporate social network — for every customer with Office 365 subscription. Yammer will be seamlessly turned on for everyone with a business or education account over the next two months, which means more and more people will rely on it in their daily communication. Pretty exciting!</p>
<p>If you’re a long-time StackStorm user, chances are you already know what’s going to happen. After all, we only write articles with words like “pretty exciting” in them when we have something great to show, and this one is no exception: today we’re proud to announce <strong>ChatOps integration with Yammer</strong> for both Community and Enterprise editions of StackStorm!</p>
<p>If you’re new to ChatOps, it’s a chat-centric way to enable or extend DevOps — especially when based upon StackStorm. With the help of our powerful rules engine, workflows, and more, you can execute actions from your chat app of choice, keep it visible for your team, and grow your automation patterns over time. Naturally, our own blog has a lot of articles on the topic, like the recent <em><a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/02/03/on-force-multiplication-and-event-driven-automation/">On Force Multiplication and Event-driven Automation</a></em> by James Fryman.</p>

<p>We have always wanted StackStorm to be much more transparent than older run book automation systems so that users trust it – so they allow StackStorm to do more and more of the work such as quashing 2am pages via auto-remediation.</p>
<p>Recently we’ve added some capabilities that further increase StackStorm’s transparency.</p>
<p>This post focuses on a few features that help follow the breadcrumbs of an event-driven automation. It specifically provides ways to answer the questions –</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why does this rule not work?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What did StackStorm do with the event that it received?</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We will put these question in context of a StackStorm Auto-remediation. The example for this blog will use StackStorm to auto-remediate an application that at times has poor API response times. The cast for this plot will be StackStorm as the guardian and protector, Sensu as the watcher and an application that must be brought back to the light when it starts erring in its ways.</p>
<p>We will specifically demonstrate the use of <code>st2-rule-tester</code> as well as what we call Trace Tags. As always in these kinds of “tutorial” blogs – we include the actual StackStorm content.</p>

<p>Recently, I have found myself reflecting on the statement “Be a force multiplier”. This usually comes to mind when faced with some sort of burn-out: hearing in indirectly from a colleauge or friend, or experiencing it first hand. The intent is good and aligns well with some core tenants of DevOps. Force multiplication fits into the DevOps ethos by encouraging the need to cross-train and collaborate. By working together and sharing knowledge about respective domains (Development or Operations), team members gain empathy for each other. This in turn has a downstream effect of now enabling better collaboration around the repair/growth/operation/expansion of the delivery pipeline.</p>
<p>The only challenge that I have seen over and over again is that by the time that this idea of “force multiplication” is needed in a team, one or more major bottlenecks exist. These bottlenecks are often real and a result of an imbalance of resources. Servers arriving faster than there are resources to rack/stack/configure/turn-up. DBAs cannot handle the number of schema changes needed to be reviewed/tested/deployed. Developers must wait on a certain person or persons who have access to publish a package before it can “go live”. You probably have your own bottleneck that you see very clearly in your own mind.</p>

<p>Fellow automators, we are happy to announce StackStorm 1.3. In this “Holiday release” (yes most of the work took place around the holidays) we took a break from “big features” and focused on addressing key learnings from extensive field usage, turning feedback from our expert users, and our own take aways from internal StackStorm use, into practical product improvements. The highlight of the release is a long-awaited ability to restart a workflow from a point of failure. We have been pushing it through for quite a while, first in upstream OpenStack Mistral, than exposing it via StackStorm, and now it’s ready for the prime time. With other highlights – making it easier to debug rules, track complex automation executions, and keep the history size under control – 1.3 release is a major step up in making StackStorm performant, operational and convenient.</p>
<p>Read on to learn about release highlights and what is coming up next. To upgrade, <a href="https://stackstorm.reamaze.com/kb/installation/upgrade-from-v1-dot-2-to-v1-dot-3">follow this KB</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about a real problem that all of us have faced at one point or another: keeping track of a single thread of work across many disparate tools. Regardless of the specific industry a company operates in, as a company grows, back-office applications in support of the business begin to accumulate. Many knowledge based companies have some sort of communication tool, some sort of project tracker, and some support tracker. These are tools that aim at being more effective with daily business process. Conversations suffice until they do not, and tools are implemented as the need arises. Every tool that was added has purpose, solves a critical need, and made you and/or your team more productive.</p>
<p>At some point however, this changes. Discovery starts to become a major issue as usage patterns between different tools leaves solos of data. It becomes hard to correlate the different company pipelines that ultimately drive your business: the pipeline to care and communicate for customers, the pipeline to deliver new features, and the human interfaces involved in each. This is only intensified by team members that work on different project with different tools and people, you introduce team members from a timezone not your own, the sheer quantity of work… how many ways can you name how not just conversations are lost, but <em>context</em></p>

<p>Before moving to Openstack integration I’d like to post a short article about highly demanded feature, which is going to be implemented and supported natively out of the box by StackStorm one day, – Chatops Action Confirmation.</p>
<p>In short, some actions, requested from chatops, may indeed be dangerous and typo errors or incorrectly entered values may harm your system or lead to unexpected, unpredictable and undesirable results. That being said, it would be really nice to ask the user who issued the command to confirm his or her intentions to execute it.</p>
<p>So for now we have to do it on our own. And I’ll tell you what – it is not really difficult. We will examine two chatops aliases and I will elucidate on the things happening under the hood when these aliases are triggered.</p>

        Stackstorm: from Nagios integration to Openstack automation

<p>Recently I’ve been playing around Stackstorm – a platform for integration and automation of day-to-day tasks, monitoring events, existing scripts and deployment tools.</p>
<p>I am going to explain how easy it is to wrap your daily tasks into Stackstorm actions and workflows and how to provide a simple way of execution for complex tasks.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking for a while and initially I was going to bring everything up in one blog post. But later, it didn’t seem like a good idea. That being said, I’d rather break it into multiple posts, no matter how many there would be. Anyway, it seems to me that it’d be more practical and easier to read and understand.</p>
<h2 id="nagios">Nagios</h2>
<p>Let’s start with integrating Nagios alerts into Stackstorm. Assuming that you already have Stackstorm version 1.2.0+ installed, configured and running, as well as there’s Nagios running somewhere else that is capable of processing alerts and handling events. If not, please, proceed to &lt;www.stackstorm.com&gt; and &lt;www.nagios.org&gt; (installation and initial configuration of these two tools is beyond the scope of this post). Both tools are open source and free to use and have extensive documentation on installation and basic configuration.</p>
<p>First of all, I was happy to find an existing Nagios integration pack <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-nagios">on StackStorm community repo</a>, but my joy ended really quickly as I found it not working. Secondly, <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/05/auto-remediation-out-of-disk-space/">this StackStorm tutorial</a> helped me to get started.</p>

You’ve studied <a href="https://victorops.com/chatops-for-dummies/">ChatOps for Dummies</a>…</p>
<p>Congratulation and welcome to the journey, ChatOps is awesome way to run development and operations. I’ll spare repeating why ChatOps is good – you’ve eager to get going. I’d rather focus on few common pitfalls and misconceptions that can get you off the track.</p>

<p>The holidays are upon us and we decided to celebrate with our v1.2.0 release of StackStorm! StackStorm v1.2.0 follows up as an update to our blockbuster <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/11/02/stackstorm-v1-is-out/">v1.1.0</a>.</p>
<p>StackStorm 1.2 features significant changes to ChatOps, some smaller improvements and plenty of bug fixes. Lets walk through some of the highlights –</p>
<h2 id="chatops">ChatOps</h2>
<p>The ChatOps changes are so extensive that we decided to dedicate a separate blog <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/12/08/stackstorm-1-2-0-the-new-chatops/">here</a>. Once users familiarized themselves with StackStorm-powered ChatOps we received excellent feedback which has been translated into some of the improvements in this release.</p>
<p>The major theme is extending further your control of your ChatOps and especially what is presented in your precious chat real-estate.  We commercially support ChatOps – and we think improve it greatly versus rolling your own flavor of a bot or directly connecting more and more integrations to chat.</p>
<p>While we were at it we also took the liberty of reworking some StackStorm internals to better suit ChatOps needs thus enabling some of the features and opening up the door for many more future improvements.</p>

<p>ChatOps — a concept where a chat bot acts as a control plane for your operations — has always been a core part of StackStorm. It adds context to your actions, automates routine tasks nobody likes, helps team members communicate better and learn from each other, and sometimes it’s just plain fun. If you’re new to this, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37LmuHToYjQ">DevOps Next Steps talk</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jfryman">James Fryman</a>, and if you’ve been writing Eggdrop scripts in IRC since you were five but never used it in your daily operations, you might also get inspired from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw">ChatOps at GitHub talk</a> by Jesse Newland.</p>
<p>Today, we’re all excited to introduce — as a part of our <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v1.2.0">1.2.0 release</a> — a completely revamped ChatOps feature list. If you’re already using our Hubot integration to execute StackStorm actions from chat, stop doing whatever it is you’re doing and update! If not, it’s a good time to get started: ChatOps is the way of the future, now more than ever.</p>

<p>This tutorial will show you how to leverage the power of the StackStorm API to expose your fantastic new workflows built using the Flow (available to Enterprise Edition uses) by <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/02/tutorial-of-the-week-cassandra-auto-remediation/">following one of the blogs</a>.</p>
<p>In our fictional scenario, we have built 2 complex workflows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Engage Tractor Beam, this workflow deploys some virtual machines to cloud, uses Hubot to notify the staff and then Puppet to drive the tractor beam.</li>
<li>Open/Close loading bay doors, this workflow takes the desired state of the doors to drive another workflow.</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to provide our technical operations team with a really simple UI where they can just click these buttons and we hide the magic behind the scenes.</p>
<h2 id="starting-off">Starting off</h2>
<p>First off, this is a tutorial for ASP.NET 4.5, MVC 5 and WebAPI 2.0, the latest Microsoft Web Development toolkit.</p>
<p>If you want to use another stack, you can follow the patterns here to repeat in another language.</p>

<p>We’re really happy Sayli Karmarkar and Jean-Sebastien Jeannotte are joining in, willing to take all manner of automation, StackStorm and Netflix and specifically Cassandra (DataStax) questions.  As in “why don’t they talk auto remediation in House of Cards?”  haha.</p>
<p>Sayli and JS are directly responsible for Cassandra (DataStax) operations at Netflix as well as building and running what they call Winston, their StackStorm based auto-remediation as a service offering at Netflix.  So come armed with Cassandra (DataStax) questions too.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As you’ll see the format is a Google Hangout.  Our own <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DoriftoShoes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (aka “Patrick”) will take questions as well – you can share them then via the hangout once it starts or via twitter through #AskAnAutomator.  Feel free to bring your #badauto scenarios as in “a friend of mine said one time their automation pulled all their servers out of the queue on Cyber Monday.”  Or, “my ChatBot keeps telling jokes that are not humorous.”</p>

<p>As you can guess from the version identifier (since v1.1.0 release we are following <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>), this is minor release which means there are no breaking or backward incompatible changes and the release mostly includes smaller improvements and bug fixes.</p>

<p>A new release of StackStorm is out…. and (…drums…) it is version 1.1!</p>
<p>Yes, this is a major release. The product has really come together, so we decided to name it “version 1”. In his recent <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/28/hello-world-stackstorm-is-ga-1-1-shipping/">Hello World blog</a> Evan Powell shared the learnings over two years that become foundation of StackStorm and made it a distinct product.

<p>A host is running out of disk space. What follows is a routine pager panic and rush in cleaning things up, at best. At worst, downtime. It is silly, but it happens much more than most of us care to admit.</p>
<p>This, and many other annoying events like this can, and shall be auto-remediated. The “classic” pattern of wiring monitoring to and paging is simply not good enough, and know it when you’re paged at 3am to clean the disk on production server.</p>
<p>And to those of you who hard-wire their remediation scripts into Nagios/Sensu event handlers, Splunk alert scripts and NewRelic web hooks: it is plain wrong there’s a better way.</p>
<p>In this blog, we show how StackStorm auto-remediation platform helps you hand out-of-disk case, with step-by-step walk-through and a working automation sample to kick-start your auto-remediation.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-octopusdeploy">What is OctopusDeploy?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.octopusdeploy.com">Octopus Deploy</a> is an automated deployment tool for .NET and Windows environments. It has gained significant popularity amongst the .NET development community for it’s ease of use and integration into the Microsoft development ecosystem. OctopusDeploy enables users to automate deployment of applications, packages and tools to Windows environments.</p>
<h2 id="why-integrate-octopusdeploy-into-stackstorm">Why integrate OctopusDeploy into StackStorm?</h2>
<p>Octopus Deploy provides a rich system for Windows application deployments, but this is typically part of a wider DevOps process. Unlike StackStorm, it does not support closed-loop monitoring, remediation or infrastructure configuration and building, it does not integrate into configuration management tools (nor claim to). If you want to integrate OctopusDeploy from another tool, as part of a DevOps or environment tool you could</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If “SLAs”, “five 9 uptime”, “pager fatigue” and “customer support” are phrases you use everyday in your work, you know by now auto-remediation is a serious use case. If you are running critical infrastructure of any kind, you may already be looking into auto-remediation, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or even using it like Facebook, LinkedIn, Netflix (more on that later). The idea is that if you are running critical systems of any kind, you need to see when events happen and to act on them as fast as humanly possible. Actually, no, to improve mean time to recovery you need to respond <em>FASTER</em> than humanly possible.</p>

<p>One thing I tried to do when helping kick off the “software defined storage” craze some years ago was to define what we meant at Nexenta by that term.  A number of analysts in the space were positive about our clarity as were, more importantly, many users and partners.</p>
<p>I realized that while we’ve blogged here and there about what we mean at StackStorm by auto-remediation, we have not directly posited a canonical definition of it.  People seem to grok that auto-remediation is a subset of event-driven automation however it is nigh time for us to have a single spot for our take on the definition.  With no further adieu, please read on and comment back here or via twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Auto remediation</strong> is an approach to automation that responds to events with automations able to fix, or remediate, underlying conditions. Remediation means more that simply clearing an alert; for example, it can mean ascertaining the scope of a problem through automated validation and investigation, noting the diagnosis of a problem in a ticketing system and very often in a chat system as well as in a logging system, and then taking a series of steps where each step’s completion or failure can be a prerequisite for the next step.</p>

<p>The task at hand is to connect Stackstorm to your pre-existing Saltstack infrastructure. Why? Well, by doing this you can turn all of your existing Salt actions into StackStorm actions, allowing you to use StackStorm for your overall event driven automation while Salt remains focused on remote execution and other use cases. This is a pattern we are increasingly seeing – so let’s try it out!</p>
<p>This blog covers both proper configuration of Saltstack NetAPI allowing for Stackstorm usage as well as how to install and configure the salt pack within StackStorm. This tutorial covers <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-salt#scenario-2-st2-using-salt-netapi">Scenario 2 listed on the Salt pack README</a>.</p>

<p><em>Insights from WebEx Spark’s talk at the OpenStack Summit on how they boosted operational agility</em></p>
<p>Recently I watched again the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->presentation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Reinhardt Quelle from Cisco Spark/ WebEx gave at the OpenStack Vancouver summit. It is an engaging presentation that covers a number of patterns, and a few anti patterns – everything from how they shifted their culture and org structure to Riak vs. Cassandra and PaaS vs. IaaS and much more besides.  StackStorm does get a positive mention, so I’m biased – but that’s just a small piece of what is a great talk.</p>
<p>In this blog I’ll give you the cliff notes and some pointers to dive into relevant sections.</p>
<p>If you find this interesting I strongly recommend that you invest 45 minutes to watch the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->original<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Also – Reinhardt’s team will be co-hosting the upcoming <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Event Driven Automation Meet-up <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in San Francisco at their offices July 29th.  Stop by to meet the team and dig in with them on these and other subjects.</p>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Culture:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></p>
<p>Reinhardt starts off by providing some context, beginning with the approach Cisco took to setting up Spark.  Leadership had already determined that trying to gradually evolve WebEx operations and development towards DevOps best practices was fraught with difficulty and likely to fail.</p>

        Automated Troubleshooting With StackStorm and Mistral

      <p><strong>July 08, 2015</strong><br>
<em>by Dmitri Zimine</em></p>
<p>Recently someone on #stackstorm IRC asked how to build a simple troubleshooting automation: <em>“on cron, ping a server, and dump the stats to the log for analytics; post the failure to Slack immediately if the ping fails.”</em> Our short answer was <em>“use Mistral workflow”.</em> In this post, I’ll use this simple case to walk you through the details of setting up a basic automation, powered by Mistral workflow.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openstack/mistral">Mistral</a> is a workflow service that we help develop upstream in OpenStack. It gives features and reliability that are missing in simple workflows like our own ActionChain or Ansible’s (details in <a href="http://stackstorm.com/2015/04/10/the-return-of-workflows/">“Return of workflows”</a>). Mistral comes embedded and supported with StackStorm.</p>
<p>The scenario I use here is obviously simplification: in a typical deployment, monitoring is set up to do heavy-lifting on issue identifications, and a variety of devops tools are used to troubleshoot and remediate issues. StackStorm gives a <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org">fair bunch of lego-blocks</a> to integrate existing devops tools, and build more realistic automation workflows. Yet, the production development flow and the patterns are going to be just as in this simple example.</p>
<p>I’ll take an opportunity to go over some basics of using StackStorm. It’s all <a href="http://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/">documented</a>, but doesn’t hurt to repeat some in context, and share my tips and tricks.</p>
<p>For you impatient kinds: the final version is available as a pack on GitHub, <a href="#install_example">made-ready to install</a>.</p>

<p>These days StackStorm is used in so many ways by users big and small from CI/CD through to auto scaling and auto remediation that sometimes the most basic of use cases can get over-looked.</p>
<p>As folks like WebEx recently have explained, the first value they got out of StackStorm was pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>StackStorm enabled them to pull together all their existing automations – i.e. scripts – and to have them managed in one place.</p>
<p>As a user put it:</p>

<p>ChatOps brings the context of work you are already doing into the conversations you are already having. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jfryman<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatOps is still a fresh and uncommon thing in the DevOps world, where work is brought into a shared chat room. You can run commands directly from chat and everyone in the chatroom can see the history of work being done, do the same, interact with each other and even learn. The information and process is owned by the entire team which brings a lot of benefits.</p>

<p>With our recent announcement of our ChatOps integration and of our commercial support for ChatOps and ChatOps related dev ops professional services, we thought it would be fun to take a moment and share our insights into the design decisions that we made while developing this feature. Several core platform changes were introduced, including Action-Aliases and Notifications, to enable ChatOps. So, grab some popcorn, get cozy, and we let’s dive in!</p>

<p>A common request among users of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DripStat<!-- raw HTML omitted --> APM is to get their alerts inside PagerDuty. Today we will show how using StackStorm, one can connect DripStat to PagerDuty.  So why bother using StackStorm? Well, StackStorm gives you thousands of integrations plus the ability to tie them together with a rules engine, workflow, audit, a GUI and CLI, API, and more.</p>
<p>StackStorm is like an “If This, Then That” but for your operating environment.</p>
<p>Once DripStat informs you that something has gone wrong with the system, you can use StackStorm to automate more and more of your responses to such events and conditions. Thus making a self healing data center.</p>

<p>I am pleased to announce the availability of our new platform feature, ChatOps.</p>
<p>It’s true, yes. We have had ChatOps support for quite some time. However, a while back after receiving user feedback, we decided to give what we had built a good once over. To that end, ChatOps is dead. Long Live ChatOps! What we are releasing today is the result of these efforts.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-chatops">What Is ChatOps?</h2>
<p>ChatOps is a new operational paradigm where work that is already happening in the background today is brought into a common chatroom. In doing so, you are unifying the communication about what work should get done with actual history of the work being done. Deploying code from chat, viewing graphs from a TSDB or logging tool, or creating new Jira tickets are all examples of tasks that can be done via ChatOps.</p>

<p>We’re always happy when the number of integrations to StackStorm increases, creating bridges between more DevOps tools and extending possible use cases.  Our IFTTT for Ops approach – or Event Driven Automation – becomes more valuable the more ways to control and listen to your environment come pre-integrated, “batteries included.”</p>
<p>Recently, an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ansible integration pack<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was added to StackStorm Exchange, giving users the possibility to use Ansible as an underlying remote change and configuration management tool in conjunction with StackStorm.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we cover CI part of CICD with Docker as an example. At a high level, this blog post will demonstrate how to create a docker image and push it to a registry on every commit to a github repo. You have probably read our own James Fryman’s excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on continuous delivery with StackStorm in a more traditional environment. If not, I highly recommend reading it. Also, this recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from docker is a great introduction to using docker in continuous delivery. Before diving into the details, below is some motivation for switching to container based immutable infrastructure.</p>

<p>As Michael Dehaan of Ansible fame notes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->immutable infrastructure is the way of the future<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Containers (especially, Docker) facilitate this by offering users a way to define their infrastructure through simple files (Dockerfile, for example). The role of orchestration tools changes when dealing with immutable infrastructure. A relevant quote from Michael Dehaan’s blog:</p>

<p>Time and time again, we hear of companies achieving rapid acceleration with DevOps. Companies are touting success with the metric of deploys/day, sharing new baselines of 10, 50 or even 100 deploys/day. In more mature organizations the likes of LinkedIn, Netflix, Etsy, Facebook and others, this number is a startling 1,000+ number. But, what does this even mean?</p>
<p>Unpacking this number is often one IT leaders stumble on, and is the greatest source of pushback when talking about rapid acceleration. How stable is the software being delivered? How many of these deployments are successful? What constitutes a deployment?</p>
<p>These questions and more often end up creating analysis paralysis, and nothing changes. In fact, the most common response starts with, “There is no way we could implement something like that at my company because…” We know this to be false. Companies who have traditionally delivered in a waterfall fashion with a single, bloated deploy per month or quarter are successfully transitioning to rapid deployment posting similar baseline numbers as other teams.</p>
<p>How then can you be successful in beginning software delivery? There is no single silver bullet or magic wand, but there is a fairly prescriptive methodology for achieving our goal of rapid delivery. Let’s dive in and take a look on how to get started.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s inaugural <!-- raw HTML omitted -->event-driven automation meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was informative, and a lot of fun.</p>
<p>LinkedIn did a great job of hosting and accommodating us at the last minute, as reservations exceed expectations and a larger room, more pizza, and beer were needed.</p>
<p>It was great to see friends from Netflix, HP, Facebook, Asurion, eBay, VISA and elsewhere in attendance. The questions were sharp and direct. As someone pointed out – “event-driven automation” is a relatively new space now getting tremendous attention as operators seek to compare notes on how they are boosting their operational agility through intelligent automation.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend the talks given by both Brian Sherwin and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dmitri Zimine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Brian’s talk got right into why and how LinkedIn built what they are calling Nurse. His talk was engaging and straightforward and Nurse itself is clearly extremely well thought through. Nurse has been designed to do remediations as simply as possible, with workflow and basic event handling included. While Nurse is relatively new and is being rolled out more broadly within LinkedIn, it already is handling some thousands of plans a week. It is run as a true Remediation as a Service in that the developers themselves – who are responsible for most of the ops of their code – utilize Nurse to save time and improve availability of their applications a pattern we also see frequently with StackStorm. LinkedIn has not yet open sourced Nurse; however, Brian indicated that they are interested in doing so.</p>

<p>ChatOps is the methodology of bringing operations work that you are already doing into the context of the conversation you are currently having. Ultimately, leveraging ChatOps leads to increased transparency and democratized IT delivery. To achieve this, SMEs should codify their knowledge using a system such as StackStorm to help form that information so that it is consumable by everyone.</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="https://youtu.be/IhzxnY7FIvg">talk</a> discussing not only the philosophy behind and history of ChatOps, but also best practices for implementing and maintaining ChatOps in your environment.</p>
<p>With our v0.9 release, we have added a feature to enable ChatOps. ChatOps via StackStorm is ready for trial and we would really appreciate some feedback. Please follow the <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/blob/master/instructables/chatops.md">instructions</a> to set up ChatOps using StackStorm.</p>

<p>The pace here never seems to let up, and in fact it just keeps accelerating, as Thursday we introduced the general release of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->version 0.9<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of StackStorm. The new release supports an important partnership with Microsoft and adds some new visual authoring tools in our new WebUI to simplify use of StackStorm.</p>
<p>Additionally, as always, we are listening to you on IRC (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#stackstorm on Freenode<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and to our supported customers as well and constantly improving and fixing the platform itself.  Please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v0.9.0">release notes</a> to see all the details.</p>
<h6 id="microsoft-integrations">Microsoft Integrations</h6>
<p>With 0.9 we will be supporting Microsoft products and services including Azure and Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>We will talk much more about this relationship in the next week or two along with our friends at Microsoft. As an aside, I’m absolutely flummoxed – in a good way – by the enthusiasm and professionalism and, yes, friendliness of the team we work with at Microsoft. I’ve dealt with pre anti-trust Microsoft and still carry scars from all those years ago. As many have pointed out, today’s Microsoft is a lot, lot different than in those days.</p>
<p>As you’ll note, we are not charging for StackStorm on Azure. We’re hopeful this will be another way for users to try out StackStorm without much friction. Note that Rackspace integration for StackStorm is of course strong as well and we have users running us on Digital Ocean and AWS of course as well.</p>

<p>Our own James Fryman has written the foreword to a new book from VictorOps, titled <em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ChatOps for Dummies<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em>. The book is described as “a high-level guide to understanding the origins of the practice, the benefits and tools needed to get started, and important examples and tips to remember as you begin to explore ChatOps for your team.”</p>
<p>What’s the connection between ChatOps and StackStorm, and why should you care? StackStorm is used as the automation platform underlying ChatOps implementations at companies as diverse as Rackspace and various large SaaS operators and financials.</p>
<p>These users benefit from StackStorm running underneath the actual bot delivering the integration to chat – typically HuBot. Instead of having the chat client or the underlying bot as yet another integration to be wired together NxN across the environment, StackStorm users simply plug ChatOps into StackStorm and they have immediate access to the several hundred integrations already available in the StackStorm community.</p>
<p>Via ChatOps, all of the systems into which StackStorm ties can be accessed – and can be automated. Also help, audit, redundancy and manageability are built into StackStorm, which further reduces the maintenance burden. Plus, users can actually “see” the execution of long running tasks, greatly simplifying troubleshooting.</p>

Actions are the cornerstone of the StackStorm system, representing what we commonly refer to as ‘lego bricks’. Actions are what StackStorm ties together to compose complex workflows to drive even the most complex cases.</p>
<p>Today, we will explore actions within StackStorm. By the end of this article, you’ll have a great understanding of how…</p>
<ul>
<li>to understand and create action metadata files.</li>
<li>and when to use each of the action runner types.</li>
<li>to create actions that execute code in any language.</li>
<li>to create actions using native Python hooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to start your automation journey? Buckle up, and let’s dive in!</p>

<p>Recently workflows have emerged as a fundamental part of the operational wiring at companies as diverse as AWS, Facebook, HP, LinkedIn, Spotify, and Pinterest, which just <a href="http://engineering.pinterest.com/post/113376157699/open-sourcing-pinball">open sourced Pinball</a>. We’ve witnessed a spike of interest in workflow-based automation, and a few interesting implementations coming to the open-source world in just the last year or two: <a href="http://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mistral">Mistral</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TaskFlow">TaskFlow</a> from OpenStack ecosystem, <a href="http://www.openscore.io/#/">Score</a> from HP, <a href="http://data.linkedin.com/opensource/azkaban">Azkaban</a> from LinkedIn, <a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi">Luigi</a> from Spotify, and <a href="http://dray.it/">dray.it</a> by CenturyLink for the Docker ecosystem, to name a few.</p>
<p>Workflows are used to orchestrate operations in infrastructure and applications, automate complex CI/CD processes, coordinate map/reduce jobs, and handle jobs to containers.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that when it comes to higher level automation and orchestration, workflows are widely used. To quote the Pinterest blog: “In realistic settings it’s not uncommon to encounter a workflow composed of hundreds of nodes. Building, running and maintaining workflows of that complexity requires specialized tools. A Bash script won’t do.” Workflows are superior to scripts in concept and in practicality.</p>

<p>Day in and day out, the team at StackStorm is building tools that take away pain from the daily lives of Operations and Developers in IT Departments everywhere. We do this by focusing our efforts on absorbing all the Glue Code, the small snippets of code that tie together tools in your organization, and relieving the developer and operator of much of the traditional management overhead associated with automations. We also need to make sure that the tools we provide <em>around</em> StackStorm are equally enjoyable and frictionless to use. To that end, I would like to share with you how to rapidly build integrations with our integrated development environment, <code>st2workroom</code>.</p>
<h6 id="what-is-stackstorm">What is StackStorm?</h6>
<p>If you’re just getting started with StackStorm, or are curious what it is, we have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great primer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the product… Take a moment, head over there, and give it a quick read or watch. We’ll be right here when you get back.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, StackStorm provides Event Driven Automation. StackStorm integrates with your various tools, and manages orchestration based on events that occur in your environment.</p>

        How StackStorm Partnered With Rackspace DevOps And New Relic To Deliver A Workflow To Automatically Scale

<p><em>This article originally appeared on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New Relic’s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</em></p>
<p>I am hard pressed to think of a challenge in operations today as complex as Infrastructure Autoscaling. In this single use case several unique subsystems must all play in concert to facilitate the delivery of computing resources with little or no human involvement. Done right, it is difficult to deny the magic of a workflow coming together to provide truly elastic infrastructure.</p>
<p>But the challenges in a real-world implementation of an autoscaling infrastructure are many, with one of the chief issues being a lack of flexibility. Many organizations have large investments in existing processes and technologies. When an autoscaling solution doesn’t allow for integration with a specific monitoring service, or users want additional control on how machines are managed, the end result is often to avoid the integration altogether or build custom code.</p>
<p>All this being said, when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was approached by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rackspace DevOps<!-- raw HTML omitted -->organization to help solve for custom workflows, we jumped at the opportunity! Who doesn’t love a good challenge? In the course of about a week, we were able to create a fully working solution composed of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rackspace Cloud infrastructure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New Relic alerting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and, of course, StackStorm. What I hope to share with you today is just how easy complex tasks like workflow automation can be tailored to your specific flavor of infrastructure.</p>

<p>It’s been another exciting week here at StackStorm. Feedback is pouring in and we are all busy addressing it and cranking out new features. Thank you for your wonderful input and appreciation. Here is a recap of what we did this week:</p>
<h6 id="stackstorm-platform">StackStorm Platform</h6>
<p>We’ve turned on authentication by default for package based deployments. In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->st2express<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we have a simple file based auth as proof of concept. It might be a good time to read about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->setting up auth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in StackStorm. We also improved the sensor container to automatically load/unload/reload sensors on sensor model create/delete/update events. You can now simply write a sensor, register it with StackStorm and the sensor is picked up automatically. Perhaps it’s time for you to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hack a sensor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and contribute to our growing list of packs in our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm Exchange<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 😉 Look out for some of these features that will be rolled out as part of our 0.9 release.

<p>The last couple of weeks we have hit an inflection point in that downloads are running at 5-7x February levels, IRC chats are getting more and more substantive, and folks like Rackspace and others are contributing to StackStorm (thank you! – let’s automate all the things – <em>intelligently</em> – together :)).</p>
<p>Here are some highlights including a few events at which we attended and spoke:</p>

<li><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Security BSides Ljubljana<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> – our own Tomaz Muraus spoke at BSides in Slovenia about using StackStorm as IFTTT-like software for responding to security events.

<p>One might think with all the efforts behind the 0.8 release, we’d take some much deserved time off — but alas, no such luck! There are too many important and exciting things to do around here. Without further ado, here is what we’ve been up to:</p>
<h6 id="stackstorm-platform">STACKSTORM PLATFORM</h6>
<p>With the 0.8 release out into the wild, we quickly pushed out a few patch releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>v0.8.1 – This was somewhat larger than expected for our first patch, but it included some scale improvements to support the brand new UI (have you tried it yet?). Then we got greedy and added a few more fixes while we worked on some patch mechanics. Bug fixes, scale improvements and some additive features.

<p>Too often industry pundits like myself make our names by screaming louder than the other pundit and by making outlandish projections in the hopes of cutting through the clutter, building our twitter followers, and otherwise achieving more pundit points.</p>
<p>Currently, I hear the extremists shouting about Chef vs. Docker and Docker vs. Rocket and Docker vs. OpenStack. I guess I hear a lot about Docker.</p>
<p>Last week, as an example, I heard folks clearly smarter than me making some pretty aggressive statements at the Pacific Crest Emerging Technology Summit, where I was one of the Mosaic experts PacCrest asked to speak to large institutional investors about cloud and trends in enterprise IT. I also heard some diatribes at Rackspace::Solve, where Rackspace demonstrated its use of StackStorm as a foundation of their DevOps services.</p>

<p><em>This post originally appeared on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VentureBeat<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</em></p>
<p>DevOps is hot. Google Trends <!-- raw HTML omitted -->confirms<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that awareness of the term has exploded over the last eighteen months, and DevOps gurus like Gene Kim and Patrick Dubois — who is credited with coining the term DevOps — are becoming even more widely read and consulted by a range of companies. Even so-called “legacy” companies, such as Target, Ford, and Johnson and Johnson are embracing and experimenting with DevOps.</p>
<p>And yet, as discussed in my last <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the barriers to enterprises achieving the kind of productivity boost that DevOps adoption promises are considerable and often non-obvious. These non-obvious barriers have confounded even the companies now acknowledged as the most productive creators and operators of software in history: companies like Facebook, eBay/PayPal, Amazon Web Services, Apple, and others.</p>
<p>How have the most successful operators overcome the barriers to DevOps adoption and achieved the sort of 10-20x, or even 50x boosts in agility, that have allowed them to innovate at a higher level than competitors and even change the world?</p>

<p>If you run an application on a JVM, it is inevitable that you are at some point going to run into issues such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>OutOfMemory exception</li>
<li>High GC pause times</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the above is inevitable, you want to ensure your infrastructure is set to automatically detect and deal with the above issues. Otherwise you <em>are</em> looking at downtime sometime in the future.</p>
<p>With a combination of DripStat and StackStorm, we are moving in a world of fully automated data centers. Let’s see how we can use them to completely automate dealing with above issues so we don’t get any downtime.</p>

<p>IT is undergoing its most important shift in at least 20 years, and devops is at the core of this transformation. Devops is moving to the enterprise, but barriers to adoption still remain. Enterprises should take these challenges into account when they are attempting to achieve the enhanced agility that top operators have obtained.</p>
<p>In this article, I discuss some of these under-appreciated barriers. In a subsequent article, I’ll dig into approaches I’ve seen effective in addresses these barriers.</p>
<p>Here are a few points worth raising that enterprises need to understand before assuming the path to devops will be an easy one:</p>

<p>We’re off with a bang this week, starting to roll out several new core platform features, and showing off how StackStorm can integrate into systems of all types.</p>
<h6 id="solutions">SOLUTIONS</h6>
<p>We love showing off our platform, and this week we’re releasing the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery Canary Pipeline. How about that for a title? We’ve just been lovingly calling it ‘the canary’. The aim of showing this is to demonstrate the flexibility of StackStorm as it integrates into many different tools and workflows. The code itself is pretty opinionated about how it works, but much of this code is built to be reusable, and we’re including all of the infrastructure components necessary to build and deploy the pipeline itself so you can take a look. We’re hoping it gets your imagination going, so please <!-- raw HTML omitted -->check it out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and let us know your thoughts.</p>

<p>Sensors can be long running. If sensors are written to poll external sources (for example, we blogged about our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter sensor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), it would be awesome to store state information in some place to de-dupe already processed events or even save markers (say, timestamps) to know what events have already been processed. Our “dogfooding” experience helped us take a user centric view and with that, we introduced a way for sensors to save state to key value store.</p>

<p>There have been so many times when I have been on both the receiving end and giving end of this conversation, and it goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Man, this awesome toolchain at Company <em>X</em> really makes it easy to ship software!</p>
<p>Friend: How can I get my hands on that hotness!?</p>
<p>Me: Well…. um…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the conversation shifts… and the involved engineers begin discussing and sharing the good and bad about the toolchain, things that they want to do, how it’s helped… you get the idea. Unfortunately, the best that the receiver is going to get are the abstract ideas about these tools. Wonderful after-work discussion, but really horrible in actually helping share craft to make all of our jobs easier and more efficient.</p>
<p>Let’s face it. If it’s difficult to share small code snippets with each other, forget about it when talking about trying to share entire process toolchains. Oftentimes, they are hyper-specialized to a specific company, tightly coupled with systems. There has to be a better way to share operational patterns while allowing for the tweaks and knobs that are unique to each company.</p>
<p>This is a problem begging to be solved, and we’re taking a pass at it. And what better way to do that then to show off what can be done with StackStorm with a Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration Pipeline.</p>

<h6 id="introduction">Introduction</h6>
<p>The StackStorm community repo has a rich integration pack for EC2 and Route53 action that you can find inside the <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. These actions are incredibly useful but they are just the building blocks. The real power of using StackStorm actions comes when they are stitched together into workflows. I’ve taken the two basic workflows we use for EC2 instance lifecycle management and genericized them, then added them to the AWS integration pack. I’m going to go over how these can be used to greatly simplify creation and termination of instances.</p>
<h6 id="why">Why?</h6>
<p>At StackStorm we needed a way to rapidly provision VMs that had all of our bootstrapping done…and it had to be easy to do from the command line or StackStorm UI. This version of the workflow has been simplified to remove some of our internal bootstrapping steps but still reduces the entire process of instance creation, DNS registration, and basic bootstrapping to a single command.</p>

<p>We are really excited about the new GitHub pack. It adds a Github repository sensor that emits triggers for new issues, issue comments, forks, or repository stars. In addition to the standard GitHub events there are also actions to gather GitHub traffic and clone statistics. This works fantastic in conjunction with the Librato pack mentioned below. For actions you can now add comments to an issue or pull request as well as status to a commit.</p>

StackStorm was recently invited to speak on [HangOps] to discuss a growing trend in IT Operations – event driven automation. I spoke with Brandon Burton and other community members about the basic concepts of event driven automation and how StackStorm enables companies of all sizes start or continue their journey implementing DevOps practices. Topics discussed in this podcast include: Intersecting Event Driven Infrastructure with ChatOps, Practical Use-cases for StackStorm, and future growth of the platform and community at large.

<p>It’s been one month and 5 days since we open sourced StackStorm during the OpenStack summit in Paris. Since then, our team has had our heads down developing the software, checking off the items on the roadmap, and applying learnings from the field and feedback from community users to our product.</p>

<p><strong>1. YAML for all content</strong></p>
<p>Moving to YAML for all content was the top ask from the community: many found dealing with JSON a bit cumbersome. Now all StackStorm content artifacts — rules, action and trigger definitions, and ActionChain workflows – are defined as YAML. JSON is supported for backward compatibility.</p>

<p>I’ve spoken at a couple of events, and chatted with hundreds of people at these events about an idea that has been swirling around in my head for a while now. This idea has gnawed at my subconscious throughout a big part of my career in IT Operations, but I was never really able to put my finger on what was bothering me. I just knew that lack of visibility and consistency in procedures drove me crazy. The opaque nature of action performed during an outage, or even a scheduled operation was frustrating. Post mortems were a nightmare of hazy memories, chat transcripts, and various permutations of ad hoc log parsing.</p>

<p>I’ve done a couple articles about getting StackStorm set up, an introductory video, and put a fair amount of effort towards minimizing the barrier to entry for new users.  Overall, I think StackStorm was successful in providing a quick and easy way to get our system up and running but users need more than that.  Users need to see how StackStorm can help solve their specific pain points.  We needed a way to illustrate that we can provide an easy to use solution without the steep learning curve of throwing out your existing tools.  Over a series of a few blog posts we are going to go over some of the ways that we have leveraged the StackStorm platform internally and how these solutions could map to your environment.</p>

<p>In his blog announcing Lambda, Vogel calls the solution “the easiest way to compute in the cloud.” He goes on to describe it as both a way to run arbitrary code on AWS with complete abstraction away from the underlying infrastructure including EC2 instances, AND as a fundamentally better way to compose applications through the use of Lambda as an <strong>event-driven</strong> approach to intra-application behavior.</p>
<p>What struck us as interesting was Vogel calling Lambda “an <strong>event-driven</strong> computing service for dynamic applications.”</p>

<p>Today <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we are excited to announce the open-source availability of StackStorm<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, our operations automation software.</p>
<p>StackStorm ties together your existing infrastructure and application environment so you can more easily automate that environment — with a particular focus on taking actions in response to events.</p>
<p>With StackStorm you define, and share – <em>as code</em> – your operational patterns from events and triggers through to actions taken in response.</p>
<p>Whether it is wiring together your continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) environments in a transparent way, or automating your troubleshooting and even remediation (including responses to security events, or any of the other common patterns you perform each day manually or with the help of siloed automation), StackStorm helps.</p>

<p>StackStorm connects events to actions you might want to take; and it does so through simple abstractions that allow you to reuse your approaches to managing events and to taking actions, including filtering events and applying rules and workflows. We call this sharing your <em>operational patterns</em>.</p>
<p>The approach of connecting events to actions is extremely extensible as events ranging from Nagios alerts to direct human interactions and actions from closing a ticket to interacting via our flavor of Hubot (“Stackbot”) can be tied together transparently, so they are easy to share, to manage and to control. Because of this flexibility, StackStorm solves many different problems for users, from helping with CI/CD through troubleshooting and remediation. And so StackStorm capabilities overlap to some extent with existing solutions. While we compare StackStorm to a number of such tools, StackStorm embraces the tool chain approach of DevOps operators.</p>

<p>This week’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevOps Enterprise Summit 2014<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#DOES14<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and Bank of America / Merrill Lynch Technology Innovation Summit (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->#BofAMLTech<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) have both been great experiences for StackStorm. In this blog I’d like to share a couple of observations that may be of broad interest.</p>
<p><strong>1. Soft stuff being addressed:</strong></p>
<p>DevOps is about much more than tools. It is fundamentally about a better way of designing, building and operating technology. It all comes down to people working better together as a team. That much we all know.</p>
<p>So I was not surprised when many speakers mentioned the above points. I was, however, somewhat surprised that Bank of America, Barclay’s, Target and many other organizations said they are successfully addressing both the quality of their teams in terms of training and expertise and the ways that they are being convinced or at least encouraged to adopt a better way of working. In the case of Barclay’s, Owen Gardner did a great job speaking about the need to get thousands of teams working in a more agile, DevOps friendly way and how this ruled out a just incremental approach since if you trained 50 teams a week you’d never get there. In their case they engineered an ingenious process to basically “infect” (my summation) the teams with DevOps.</p>

<p>**Why do we need another wave, and why is it like the first? **</p>
<p>Across many domains in IT you see waves such as those we are witnessing in the automation space today. A few important changes that are forcing change on many pieces of IT include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Abstraction is powerful, but “too much” is bad</strong></p>
<p>We hear this all the time from our DevOps users. They want to be able to achieve the benefits of automation – and to improve the lives of their operators, developers and especially their end users.</p>

<p><em><strong>The third wave of operations automation – what’s the same, what’s different, and what’s next?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m a bit uncomfortable referencing a cultural meme to kick off a weighty subject mostly interesting to the “data center intelligencia.”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> While Ben Horowitz has made it cool to refer to rap lyrics, he is a best-selling author and a billionaire and, conversely, I am decidedly neither.</p>
<p>Still, when I look at the wave of automation sweeping data centers and specifically hyperscale data centers, we face some questions not dissimilar from those that confronted LL Cool J so many years ago. So maybe I’m not totally crazy when those lyrics come to mind.  What’s new?  What’s rehashed?</p>
<p>We’ll begin by rolling the tape back to an era before DevOps, before AWS, and before VMware – even then time was already too short and systems were already too complex for humans alone to be left to our own devices.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to both attending and sponsoring the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevOps Enterprise Summit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which will take place on October 21-23 in San Francisco, CA.</p>
<p>While our product is currently in beta, sponsoring such a show is beneficial for a number of reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. Enterprise automation focus</strong></p>
<p>StackStorm is working towards a vision of self-driving data centers, and in November we’ll be releasing our open source software that will bring users closer to that goal.</p>
<p>A majority of our current beta users are enterprises that are seeking to connect their existing pockets of automation in a DevOps-friendly way. As an example, this means they hope to extend the benefits of automation from continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) – the domain of DevOps Enterprise prime sponsor ElectricCloud – into every piece of building and operating software.</p>
<p>We believe a vast number of enterprises are struggling with pockets of automation and are faced with real challenges in managing, extending, and controlling their automation environments. Given that many of these enterprises will be attending the event, we expect great conversations to unfold.</p>

Nice motto – what options do we have in OpenStack?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which will run through automation for OpenStack in all its forms. Led by our CTO, Dmitri Zimine, the meetup will review all Day 1 and Day 2 automation projects within OpenStack.</p>
<p>Dmitri is an expert in automation and has participated in many discussions with OpenStack operators, as well as, OpenStack forums and meetups. Prior to StackStorm, he was at VMware, where he led the vSphere Client team through four major releases and led a successful transition of vSphere Client to a new technology stack. During the meetup, Dmitri will provide an unbiased overview of automation projects including which projects are OpenStack specific, which are mature and which have momentum.</p>

<p>Continuing from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->part 1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of my blog on the recent OpenStack Silicon Valley summit, let’s discuss some of the other companies present at the conference and some of my (cynical) observations.</p>
<p>VMware was there with a keynote being given by yet another Martin. There were six substantive talks before noon. Half of them had someone named Marten or Martin in it. I’m referring here of course to VMware’s networking CTO, Martin Casado who spoke passionately about policy based management as an El Dorado of IT management that is finally within reach. I kept flashing back to the Werner Herzog film “Aguirre: Wrath of God.” Much like Klaus Kinsky in that film (spoiler alert), the quest for the golden city does not end well.</p>

<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenStack Silicon Valley<!-- raw HTML omitted --> summit took place on Tuesday, and I had a blast! There were a lot of recent developments discussed at the summit, including HP’s acquisition of Eucalyptus, and I had the opportunity to meet old friends and make some new. There’s a lot that took place, so I’ll split this into two blog posts. In this first one I’ll discuss some of the recent announcements and what HP and Cisco brought to the summit. In the second part, I’ll discuss VMware and some of my overall takeaways.</p>
<p>First, as is the case in any conference, much of the value is found in the hallways. I ran into a couple of StackStorm users and advisors, a bunch of friends I knew via Nexenta, and had some great honest conversations.</p>
<p>I think my first chat post coffee (when my brain started to switch on) was with Bernard Golden from ActiveState, Stephen Spector from HP, and Jesse Proudman from Blue Box. That got me into a great mood and gives you an idea of who attended – lots and lots of thoughtful folks willing to share their perspectives.</p>

<p>Last week StackStorm had a great group of folks online for a one hour <a href="https://www.crowdchat.net/devops">Crowdchat</a> about DevOps, and comments were fast and furious. As expected, Cote from the 451 group (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/cote">@cote</a>) helped lead the discussion, as well as James Fryman from GitHub (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jfryman">@jfryman</a>), Carmine Rimi from Workday (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/carminerimi">@carminerimi</a>), and StackStorm’s own Patrick Hoolboom (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/phool_stormer">@phool_stormer</a>). We were also joined by some great guest stars including Andi Mann (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/AndiMann">@AndiMann</a>) from CA.</p>
<p><strong>A quick summary:</strong></p>
<p>With over 1,229 views of the Crowdchat, participants rated the question, “<em>Is Automation in a place that is good, or is there more work needed?”</em> as the top question asked.</p>
<p>And the top rated response to this question suggested that we still have a long way to go with automation. James Fryman’s answer was:</p>
<p><em>“There is so much more work needed. We are a lot further along than we were, say 10 years ago, but there are still serious challenges with parts of the stack still not having good API access, humans are still doing too much manual work, etc.”</em></p>

<p>As an entrepreneur betting heavily – in time, money, and relationships – on OpenStack, I’m biased towards its success and more than a little interested in how it is growing up. I have long believed in open infrastructure and remain convinced that OpenStack is the best chance we all have for a future of greater innovation, quality, capability, and, yes, affordability for cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>I first looked at OpenStack a number of years ago when growing Nexenta and creating a market we then called the OpenStorage market, and recently took some time to look at the entire project and how far it’s come, as well as some emerging challenges.</p>

<p>At StackStorm, our mission is to lead the third wave of operations automation and enable everyone to achieve the 10-100x productivity improvements that highly automated DevOps operators achieve. We’ve been in private beta for more than a month now, and think it’s time to share our story with DevOps and IT communities.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 22, we will host our first interactive web meeting focused on DevOps automation, and we welcome your participation! Our CEO, Evan Powell will host the meeting, discussing topics such as common DevOps automation patterns, fundamentals of DevOps architectures and infrastructure as code. Evan will also introduce StackStorm’s software and give his thoughts on the future of self-driving data centers.</p>
<p>Evan will be joined by lead DevOps Stormer, Patrick Hoolboom, who most recently led DevOps efforts at Cloudmark and who is an experienced speaker at events like the recent DevOps Days Silicon Valley. Together, Evan and Dmitri will tell StackStorm’s story, request direct feedback from you, and answer any questions you may have.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to co-hosting next week’s OpenStack Online Meetup on July 17! Hosted by Rafael Knuth, OpenStack and Hadoop community manager and Stephen Spector, HP cloud evangelist, the meetup is a great forum to bring together the OpenStack IT community from across the world, to facilitate dialogue and share ideas, especially on new technologies.</p>
<p>In the meetup, our CTO and co-founder, Dmitri Zimine, will discuss automation approaches and projects within the OpenStack ecosystem. As we’ve mentioned <a href="http://stackstorm.com/2014/05/08/day-three-openstack-important-however-users-pragmatic-agnostic-ever/">before</a>, we’re big believers in OpenStack. It’s one of the largest open source projects in the world, and the community and corporate supporters of the community have made broad OpenStack adoption almost inevitable. We particularly like the OpenStack mantra “automate all the things.”</p>
<p>With the rise of OpenStack and similar approaches comes a more open environment comprised of loosely coupled components, each of which can be automated itself. Add the massive acceleration in the rate of change occasioned by agile and DevOps approaches to management and IT has an entirely new environment to manage. And automation is at the very core of current approaches to management.</p>

<p>At StackStorm, we believe that workflow is a key ingredient for cloud automation. That’s why we became drivers and core contributors to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mistral<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a new workflow service for OpenStack.</p>
<p>Why the need for a new workflow service? Haven’t we already experienced Workflow Management? Aren’t a number of established, mature workflow products<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> out there already? Yes, and yes, but…</p>
<p>With a decade of experience building system orchestration and automation products<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and seeing them used in the field, I realized that using a traditional BPM (business process management) oriented workflow is not a good match with today’s pace of change and scale of operations. The rich variety of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->workflow patterns<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are bragged about by traditional BPM systems are never used in practice. The graphical representation of workflow, so exciting for non-technical BPM users, becomes a handcuff for techy admins. And complex XML-based syntax made working with workflow definition files a nightmare.</p>

<p>DevOps is all about the community movement – it’s an approach that is inherently collaborative. That’s why we love attending DevOps events and sharing ideas with others in the industry. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevOps Days Silicon Valley<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is around the corner and we’re expecting to see some great sessions.

<p>Patrick Hoolboom, an avid Stormer and contributor to our blog, will be presenting on the “10 Reasons Why DevOps is the Greatest Shift in the IT Industry.” There is a huge shift in IT towards a DevOps approach for building and operating software, with the goal of improving productivity. Conferences like DevOps Days are evidence of this shift and growth in the community.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time talking about the positive effects of moving to a more DevOps oriented approach. The reasoning behind this because I truly believe it, and get excited just thinking about it. An interesting thing I have found is that, when explaining these concepts and what StackStorm is about to non-technical people, I almost always get the same question:</p>
<p><strong><em>“If DevOps is so great, why isn’t everyone doing it?”</em></strong></p>
<p>This is a perfectly valid question, so I thought I’d try to break it down into what I see as the biggest barriers to entry for a truly successful DevOps initiative. I thought back about the various places I have worked, or the reasons I have heard for not wanting to move away from the Operations/Development silo approach and was able to distill them down to 3 points (actually 4 but the last one seems to be wrapped up in the other three).</p>

<p>Over the years I’ve helped literally thousands of customers gain efficiencies in their data centers. I’ve met and become friendly with a lot of IT pros but I’ve got to admit – I never envied them. Well, maybe I envied some of the views in NY and Jersey City. And some of the toys they got to play with over the years were amazing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I didn’t envy them because many of my friends in director and VP roles spent a huge percentage of their time fighting politics that resulted in Orwellian distortions of the truth. A couple of stories from the early 2000s might help illustrate my point:</p>
<p><strong>1. Two guys pulling all-nighters delivering a $1.5B roll out of IP communications while 25+ project managers debate progress from 9-5</strong></p>
<p>The headline pretty much captures it. This now too-big-to-fail bank, as well as their vendor, had brought in several project and program managers to ensure groups from facilities through supply chain through security and operations were “aligned.” I spent a couple of meetings getting to know all of these project managers before realizing that there were two guys working every night, all night, to manually, using fingers and spreadsheets, push and validate changes. Eventually those operators quit – and the project ground to a halt.</p>

<p>While I am a third time founding CEO who has helped build some successful infrastructure software companies, I’m continuously learning. I don’t have a particular formula for how to build the right combination of market positioning, company capabilities, company tactics, strategies, and more.</p>
<p>In leading companies I rely on my own broad experience, common frameworks from Michael Porter and others, and surrounding myself with people smarter than me who are unafraid to show it.</p>
<p>I believe each company takes on a certain personality – a sense of the company that can be felt. This is where design thinking perhaps comes to play.</p>
<p>For example, whereas Nexenta was generally a scrappy company that needed to break the rules to shake the status quo, StackStorm’s personality is more that of a relatively polished upstart that expects to be the best at everything it does.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the first day of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenStack Summit in Atlanta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, was a great day for StackStorm and for the community. It was a pretty special day for me personally too.</p>
<p>First – the community. I appeared on <em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->theCube<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em> in which John Furrier and Stuart Miniman asked me to share some thoughts on the OpenStack community. I admit – I’ve run the tape back. On the whole I hope I hit the right balance.</p>
<p>Here’s my gripes:</p>
<ul>
<li>For all the talk about openness, too many of us run on proprietary clouds.  If, and that’s a big IF, there is a tax for running on OpenStack based open clouds like Rackspace and our friends at BlueBox and so forth – PLEASE PAY THE TAX. The Tragedy of the Commons takes many forms.</li>
<li>Speaking of the Tragedy of the Commons – I chatted with a friend who is at VMware and contributing to OpenStack, only his check-ins are not being reviewed he thinks for political reasons by the PTL (program leader) who works for a competitor. Look in the mirror PTL! Is that who you want to be?</li>

<p>I’ve read a number of articles discussing DevOps from just about every angle.  The topics range from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What Is A DevOps Engineer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There Is No Such Thing As A “DevOps Team”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The latter was written by Jez Humble who is an expert in Continuous Delivery (his book on the subject is amazing; I definitely recommend reading it). I am not going to try and dissect his statements or rebuke his article, as I agree with him. I’d like to give my spin on what DevOps is today and how it applies to the Development/Operations relationship in organizations of all sizes.</p>
<p>This blog is mostly focused on the benefits of DevOps as seen from the standpoint of the Operations Engineer. (There are a number of higher level, externally facing benefits to adopting DevOps – in the future I will dig deeper into DevOps benefits, and how that impacts the non-technical areas of the business.)</p>
<p><strong>Man or Methodology?</strong></p>
<p>Does DevOps refer to a specific role within the organization?</p>
<p>Are engineers trained to be comfortable working at all levels of the stack?</p>
<p>Or, is DevOps an umbrella term to refer to methodologies as they are applied across the organization?</p>

<p>I think a lot about positive feedback cycles these days. DevOps wins in part because by decreasing the cycle time of development and operations of new capabilities the software gets closer and closer to real user needs. This of course brings more users, which presumably brings more resources, which enables even more projects to further accelerate the delivery of new capabilities. And so on.</p>
<p>That’s the theory and the reality in many shops. However, in too many shops the automation that is core to DevOps quickly becomes technical debt. Unlike components like NoSql data bases or even underlying configuration management, there are not yet projects that have critical mass and hence have the credibility to gain more users and so forth.</p>

<p>There is a huge amount of DevOps washing going on right now, and for good reason. As CA pointed out in a recent blog, most CIOs now understand that DevOps, done right, is revolutionary. And, what is more, they understand they need to do stuff to get DevOps working. And that stuff includes buying new tools.</p>
<p>So I’m not the only person building software to notice that there is a massive opportunity to provide CIOs with the tooling they need to build <strong>and operate</strong> software in a DevOps approach. As a result it feels like every software vendor in the world is rebranding their products as DevOps friendly.</p>

        DAY THREE: OpenStack Is Important – However, Users Are More Pragmatic And Agnostic Than Ever

<p>Yesterday I wrote a bit about the need for a community to step in to empower more than the top few operators to achieve DevOps levels of productivity in developing and operating software.</p>
<p>Today I expand upon those thoughts a little bit. OpenStack is absolutely one of the top 5 reasons we founded StackStorm. It is arguably the most important OpenSource project in the world right now in part because it is so much larger than any one project, even Hadoop.</p>
<p>Which leads to driver #3:</p>
<p><strong>OpenStack is important – however, users are more pragmatic and agnostic than ever.</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday I wrote a little bit about what led us to start StackStorm, focusing on the massive shift happening in IT towards a DevOps approach to building and operating software. I don’t think you can overstate the importance of this shift.</p>
<p>However, there are barriers. And that’s where driver #2 for us starting StackStorm comes in:</p>
<p><strong>There are not enough DevOps unicorns in the world – and there never will be.</strong></p>
<p>The ideal DevOps engineer is a full stack engineer who can code at least in python and is really good at cross-functional collaboration. We are a magnet for this type of unicorn – we have hired a few and have a handful in our utterly kick-ass advisory board.</p>

<p>Today StackStorm exits stealth mode.</p>
<p>For those that have been following developments in our corner of OpenStack, we were never really in stealth mode since the StackStorm team is helping our friends at <a href="http://www.mirantis.com/">Mirantis</a> and elsewhere in a couple of projects including Mistral, or Workflow as a Service.</p>
<p>However, until today we’ve never told our story. We’ve never put our contributions into context. And we’ve never even admitted we all work here or that we are funded or that we have a snazzy logo.</p>
<p>Here goes. **“**<strong>Hello world.”</strong> This is the beginning of our introduction of StackStorm to the world. Thus, I’d like to share five drivers that led me to help found StackStorm. I’ll cover one observation for each of the next five days.</p>
<p>Before I get to that – some context. <em>StackStorm’s vision is to <strong>deliver self-driving, self-learning operations automation</strong> so that all of us can enjoy the kind of massive productivity lift that the top handful of operators already enjoy when they develop and operate software</em>.</p>

        2021-03-25 Security Incident – WordPress Intrusion and Defacement
      </a>

<p><em>by <a href="https://github.com/blag">@blag</a></em></p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>The StackStorm website – stackstorm.com – was defaced at some point around March 25th. We believe that our content management system (CMS) was hacked to serve Javascript that redirected users to a server that attempted to install malware on user devices.</p>
<p>The TSC was alerted to this by a <a href="https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/is-stackstorm-com-down-or-hacked/1620">forum post</a> at 19:14 UTC and also pointed out to us via Slack at 19:23 UTC, and was posted to our internal Slack channel at 19:31 UTC. Within minutes, members of the TSC were investigating the issue and jumped on a common Zoom war room. We were able to restore the entire server from a backup image created well before March 23rd, which we believe was prior to the security incident as well as take additional extra security hardening and steps to make sure this never happens in the future.</p>
<p>After 1.5 hours of incident acknowledgment, By 20:57 UTC we had the site is back up and running, and at this point, we believe it is secure.</p>
<p>At no point were the DNS settings for stackstorm.com or any other related domains changed, and we have no evidence that attackers were able to access any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>our DNS provider</li>
<li>our hosting provider or server directly (read: we believe that SSH is still secure)</li>
<li>our stackstorm packages, releases and versions we distribute to our community</li>
<li>any part of the codebase, including any GitHub.com accounts</li>
<li>any CI/CD accounts, workflows, build history, environment settings, or secrets</li>
<li>any of our internal infrastructure accounts (all of which are protected by TFA)</li>
<li>any part of the <a href="https://forum.stackstorm.com">StackStorm Forum</a></li>
<li>any part of the <a href="https://stackstorm-community.slack.com/">#stackstorm-community on Slack</a></li>
