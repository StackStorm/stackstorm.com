&lt;p>Site Reliability Engineering is very much the natural evolution of the trusted system administrator and most would agree the SRE role embodies the core principles of DevOps. Google consider these people consultative and of huge value. Software for the masses has changed from monolithic monsters to complex architectures, driving the adoption of new skill sets required for system administrators to evolve to an SRE. It’s no longer about restarting large services at 3am; it’s about keeping the cattle alive and producing milk, whilst at the same time ensuring that the machinery is understood and utilised correctly. This could mean writing custom components to help with performance, availability, telemetry, reporting, managing workloads and dealing with alerts etc. For this gathering of SREs, Usenix chose the location and venue well. Ireland is a techhub for many start-ups and established organisations, most if not all have SREs under employment. Some 600+ people were booked in to the event, with huge attendance from the likes of Demonware, Facebook, Google and Indeed. Many smaller organisations and individuals were also in attendance to gain from the experience of others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Perspectives on Optimizing Operations &amp; Learnings from Monitorama-5/24 (Por­tland, OR)</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2017/05/22/monitorama-portland-meetup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2017 17:35:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2017/05/22/monitorama-portland-meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>WHEN:&lt;/strong> Wednesday, May 24, 2017&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’ve seen it over and over again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A user puts in a simple request. Nothing elaborate or unusual – just a standard request. It goes into the queue, generates a ticket, and then… nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Days or weeks later, an overworked, tired engineer in the back office operations room finally gets to the request, opens a process document, and begins the laborious task of doing the same thing that he or she has done dozens of times before each time that this type of request comes in. Ok, maybe the IP address or the user name has changed, but the process is the same as it has always been. And it is slow. Very slow. And the engineer may make a mistake. And, quite frankly, it’s frustrating for the user and boring for the engineer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summary – Brocade Workflow Composer at NFD 12</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2016/08/23/summary-brocade-workflow-composer-nfd-12/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2016 02:11:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2016/08/23/summary-brocade-workflow-composer-nfd-12/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>August 23, 2016&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

&lt;em>by Evan Powell&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These days ChatOps has become all the rage. In this blog I’ll talk a little bit about how we came to be here – in a leading position when it comes to ChatOps adoption for operations. And I’ll point you to some resources from users and our own engineers to learn more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The history lesson will be brief, I promise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started StackStorm after observing that existing solutions in the devops universe were generally point solutions, often evolved from scripts and other projects that DevOps engineers wrote to make their own lives easier. And that’s a great way to build a solution that appeals at least to those types of users for those specific use cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>What we saw was that while there were leaders within certain segments amongst those tools, there was no clearly adopted pattern for the wiring that tied all these tools together. Moreover, with our backgrounds in enterprises we knew that wiring together extremely heterogeneous environments is always a challenge. The enterprise is more a brownfield than a greenfield.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quick shout out to teams at Facebook and at WebEx Spark and all those other early interviewees that taught us so much about event driven automation.
