&lt;p>Many enterprises are delivering services to millions of customers every day, and one of their key challenges is to make sure they are never without service. Working at such a large scale requires organizations to streamline DevOps processes so they can minimize errors, reduce the burden on Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and get fast visibility into potential issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are happy to welcome &lt;a href="https://www.bitovi.com">Bitovi&lt;/a> as a partner. Just recently they helped one of their clients to streamline and solve DevOps automation using Stackstorm.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
