We will use this feedback to chart the development roadmap for ChatOps, whether that means leaving st2chatops as-is, or focusing on supporting more chat providers, deeper feature support for specific providers, improving ChatOps integration with the rest of StackStorm (RBAC for ChatOps!</description></item><item><title>Sponsoring StackStorm</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2020/06/12/sponsoring-stackstorm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 19:15:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2020/06/12/sponsoring-stackstorm/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Jun 12, 2020&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

After acquiring the StackStorm product and the amazing StackStorm team in 2017 from Brocade, Extreme Networks has been a large contributor (if not the largest contributor) to the StackStorm project, even donating the code and transferring the StackStorm trademarks to the Linux Foundation last year. Continuing that tradition, Extreme Networks announced today that they were donated their enterprise extensions of StackStorm (previously StackStorm Enterprise) to the Linux Foundation!</description></item><item><title>StackStorm v3.2.0 released</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2020/04/30/stackstorm-v3-2-0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 17:43:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2020/04/30/stackstorm-v3-2-0-released/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>It happened! 🎉 After a long wait, we’re more than excited to announce the StackStorm &lt;code>v3.2.0&lt;/code> release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The StackStorm project has had some turbulent times since the previous release almost one year ago. The new v3.2.0 version is the first release since the project &lt;a href="https://stackstorm.com/2019/10/07/stackstorm-joins-the-linux-foundation/">joined the Linux Foundation&lt;/a>, formed new &lt;a href="https://stackstorm.com/2020/02/20/stackstorm-governance-and-maintainers/">Governance&lt;/a>, and gathered a new team of &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/blob/master/OWNERS.md">Maintainers&lt;/a>. Considering the amount of changes happened, it looks like a big restart for the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s awesome for StackStorm to be under new governance. But that also means everything is on the Community’s shoulders now. And while it’s harder to rely only on the community’s efforts compared to the previously dedicated team of full-time employees, these days we’re observing increased number of contributors and interest from the larger organizations to adopt StackStorm Event Driven Automation and Automated Remediation. We hope this trend continues and we are striving for a better project future and further growth, together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what’s new in StackStorm 3.2.0?&lt;br>
This version aggregated almost one hundred changes including bugfixes, new &lt;a href="#pack-dependencies">Pack Dependencies&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="#rhel-8-centos-8-support">RHEL 8 / CentOS 8 Support&lt;/a>, Orquesta &lt;a href="#orquesta-retry">retry&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="#orquesta-re-run">re-run&lt;/a> features, &lt;a href="#chatops-refactoring">ChatOps updates&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="#chatops-immutable-parameters">Immutable parameters in Action Aliases&lt;/a>, performance improvements, and more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>StackStorm Project Governance and Maintainers Update</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2020/02/20/stackstorm-governance-and-maintainers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 13:40:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2020/02/20/stackstorm-governance-and-maintainers/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feb 20, 2020&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;em>By &lt;a href="https://github.com/armab">Eugen Cusmaunsa (@armab)&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

In the last couple of weeks StackStorm has published back-to-back releases. 2.10.2 is a traditional patch release from StackStorm, and you’ll find some of the highlights below. 2.10.3 and 2.9.3; however, are releases to address CVE-2019-9580. I want to thank Barak Tawily and Anna Tsibulskaya: the researchers who discovered and submitted a patch for the issue.
The issue found by Barak and Anna is an improper handling of CORS headers.</description></item><item><title>2018 Year in Review &amp; 2019 StackStorm User Survey</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2019/01/30/2018-year-in-review-2019-stackstorm-user-survey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 15:05:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2019/01/30/2018-year-in-review-2019-stackstorm-user-survey/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Jan 30, 2019&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

&lt;p>2018 is behind us and first of all we would like to thank all of our users, community members and customers for supporting us and making 2018 a successful year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post we would like to have a look at the various things we have released and important milestones we have reached in 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to that, we would like to ask you to spare 10 minutes of your time by completing the &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/st2-2019-user-survey">StackStorm 2019 User Survey&lt;/a>. Completing the survey will give us a better idea on how you use StackStorm.

&lt;p>A couple weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://stackstorm.com/2018/09/26/stackstorm-enterprise-ha-in-kubernetes-beta/">we released&lt;/a> the Helm chart and docker images so you could install StackStorm Enterprise HA cluster in Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we’re glad to announce that the Community free and open source edition of StackStorm HA is now available, too! With this update we are excited to bring Kubernetes powers to the broader community and strive for greater adoption in production with better safety for all important operations you delegate to StackStorm automation engine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>More groups are progressing from just talking about Event-Driven Automation to actually doing it in practice. StackStorm helps make this easy. When organizations start offloading business-critical tasks and automating for real it becomes essential to ensure that the Automation engine itself is not a single point of failure when it is responsible for recovering a fleet of servers, managing datacenters, and automating remediations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>StackStorm was designed to be cloud-native, API-driven, easily deployed, microservice-oriented, resilient and can be scaled out horizontally to fulfill High Availability and/or High Load demands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously we only documented best practices describing how to distribute StackStorm in HA mode (&lt;a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html">docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html&lt;/a>), giving a high level overview regarding StackStorm design and how to ensure its redundancy. Based on those recommendations, some companies were spending weeks to months to codify a complex st2 HA infrastructure and iterate over their deployments until finding that “silver bullet” stability/production state.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ready to automatically provision and maintain StackStorm nodes in production? Then the &lt;code>stackstorm-st2&lt;/code> Puppet module is for you! We’re proud to announce the &lt;code>v1.0.0&lt;/code> stable release of &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2&lt;/a>, the StackStorm Puppet module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/puppet-st2">&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Puppet is an excellent tool that allows the user to declare the desired state of their system in code. Once defined, hand over the reins to Puppet and watch as it transforms your nodes into what you’ve declared. We wanted to bring the power of declarative state to StackStorm deployments, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">puppet-st2&lt;/a> is that solution.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So far StackStorm has multiple installation methods: deb/rpm packages, &lt;a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/index.html#ref-one-line-install">&lt;code>curl|bash&lt;/code>&lt;/a> installer used for simple deployments, &lt;a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2-docker">Docker&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2">Ansible&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/chef-stackstorm">Chef&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now it’s Puppet time!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting in July of 2017 a major effort has been underway to modernize the Puppet module to install/deploy StackStorm. In August of 2017 &lt;code>v1.0.0-beta&lt;/code> was released with completely re-worked internals to support the new StackStorm &lt;code>deb/rpm&lt;/code> package installation method and fix a large number of bugs. Since the beta we’ve continued development of new features like supporting all 4 StackStorm OSes, Puppet 4 and 5 compatibility, ChatOps installation and configuration, modernized pack management, full integration testing in Docker containers along with a slew of Puppet best practices improvements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we’re proud to announce the Release Candidate version &lt;code>v1.0.0-rc&lt;/code> of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">&lt;code>stackstorm-st2&lt;/code>&lt;/a> Puppet module which is available on Forge.&lt;br>

https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2&lt;br>

Our plan is to release &lt;code>v1.0.0&lt;/code> stable in the coming weeks, but in order to do this we need your help. We ask everyone who is interested in Puppet-based deployment to give the module a try and provide your feedback!&lt;/p>

&lt;em>by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dzimine">Dmitri Zimine&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange&lt;/a> is an open source catalog of reusable actions. Integrations with everything ranging from common-man DevOps tools, suit and tie services like ServiceNow and Remedy to cool kids like Slack or Twilio, to more exotic systems like HUE Lights and Tesla cars. At the time of writing, there are 6500+ actions spread across 130 integration packs. It is Open Source, with a great community of maintainers. Something that makes StackStorm a great wiring tool to build automations integrating a wide breadth of domains.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>But if you’ve taken a red pill and gone wholesale on AWS running serverless, deploying &lt;a href="https://stackstorm.com/">StackStorm&lt;/a> may be not an option. Yet the catalog of reusable functions to integrate with commonly used services is an appealing idea. C’mon there should be 1000 Slack lambdas and 10,000 Twilio lambdas out there already, it doesn’t feel creative to write 10,001? Jealous to Azure with their &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/apis-list#popular-connectors">great library of reusable connectors&lt;/a>? Why can’t YOU grab something ready-to-use?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you can! Run StackStorm Exchange actions as lambda functions. Without StackStorm. &lt;strong>Serverless and Stormless.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For a little while now, the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->stackstorm/stackstorm&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> docker image has been tagged with the version of StackStorm that comes pre-installed in the image. Now, you can pin your installation to a specific release of StackStorm! Images tagged with “latest” contain the most recent StackStorm release at the time it was tagged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->stackstorm/stackstorm:2.4.0&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> image will always contain the 2.4.0 release of stackstorm. The previous release, 2.3.2, is available at &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->stackstorm/stackstorm:2.3.2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We never again update &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->stackstorm/stackstorm:2.3.2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> after 2.4.0 is released.

&lt;p>In this blog, we show how to scale out a Docker Swarm Cluster based on container workload, so that you don’t over-provision your AWS cluster and pay for just enough instances to run your containers. Learn how we achieved this, watch the &lt;em>2 min video&lt;/em> to see it in action. Read the blog for details. Grab our code recipe and adjust it to your liking and use to auto-scale your Swarm on AWS.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>StackStorm was proud to once again exhibit at SREcon this year in San Francisco. If you haven’t attended SREcon before, there’s really no better place to get in touch with so many SRE professionals that are pushing the envelope and redefining what it means to run a modern operations team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year, we brought a quite nifty, flashy demonstration that one of our core developers Matt Stone put together, involving Raspberry Pis, LEDs, and – of course – StackStorm! (He’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bigmstone">@BigMStone&lt;/a> on twitter – tweet at him and tell him to write his own blog post on his creation – it’s really cool!)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The majority of StackStorm packs are created and submitted by our community. While we do code reviews and give advice, it is our users that helped us reach over 100 integrations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But a lot of people do not just stop there. Even after submitting packs, they are continuously putting effort into keeping the codebase up to date, reviewing contributions, and helping others. This effort does not go unnoticed—and in the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent post about StackStorm Exchange&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> we have announced that we will be granting pack maintainers full collaboration rights in the Exchange repositories. We are happy to introduce the first maintainers, together covering around 20 packs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notes from Scale15x</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2017/03/06/notes-from-scale15x/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 22:56:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2017/03/06/notes-from-scale15x/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mar 03, 2017&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>My talk 🙂&lt;/strong> It was a bit symbolic for me. I spoke at &lt;a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/openstack-vs-vmware-systems-administrator-perspective.html">Scale13x&lt;/a>, comparing and contrasting Enterprise Suites and OpenSource, and stated the free pillars of “Designed for DevOps”:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Infrastructure as code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social coding and collaboration&lt;/li>

&lt;p>At the DevOps Enterprise Summit in San Francisco last month, DevOps leaders like Target, American Airlines, Disney, and Quicken Loans spoke of the importance collaboration, eliminating silos, managing/optimizing operations and addressing technical debt, the importance of open source and contributing to community, and continuous learning. I was especially struck by Jason Cox of Disney, who stressed the importance of “creating a culture of courage” where teams are encouraged to be curious, to experiment, explore and embrace change–including process, roles, and technology.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ta-da! It’s here! StackStorm version 2.1 has been released, and there are some big changes. So big that we started wondering if we should have called this release version 3.0. Pack management has had a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of work done, and we think you’ll be pleased with the results. Plus good news for those patiently waiting for Ubuntu 16.04LTS support!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="packs-packs-packs8230its-mostly-all-about-packs">Packs Packs Packs…it’s (mostly) all about Packs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The big theme for this release is Pack Management. We’ve upgraded, enhanced, overhauled &amp;amp; refitted pack management, and we’re very pleased to introduce the &lt;a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org">StackStorm Exchange&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dear stormers and friends!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are almost ready with a new and quite exciting platform release. This is a big release and we are really looking forward to it, and you should, too – just check out &lt;a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org">exchange.stackstorm.org&lt;/a> to get excited about what is coming. As usual, you will soon see an announcement, a blog describing the highlights of what we’ve done, and a back-story on how and why we did it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This, however, is an unusual “head’s up”. The changes around pack management we are introducing in 2.1 are so substantial that it’s fair to give you time to review the new features, read the &lt;a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">changelog&lt;/a>, and adjust your private packs or automation around StackStorm if needed. We’re inviting you to contribute – EASILY – by trying out the new functionality and sharing feedback, or helping us catch last-minute bugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/reference/packmgmt.html">transition notes are drafted here&lt;/a>. The full list of changes is &lt;a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">in the change log&lt;/a>. Please help us improve the docs wherever you find them unclear, confusing or imprecise – we are actively testing as we write this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest change is introducing &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange&lt;/a>. All integration packs from st2contrib, as well as other packs scattered around, are being moved under &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange&lt;/a>. Once the transfer is complete, you will be submitting your new packs as PRs against &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator">StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator&lt;/a> repo, as described in &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator/README.md">README.md&lt;/a>. Making features and fixes on existing community packs will be much easier now that each pack is in it’s own GitHub repo.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To be a good Stormer is to be a good hacker. Not necessarily in the sense that you enjoy compromising unsuspecting grandmother’s laptop or a random web cam, but that you have a curiosity about how things work. This isn’t unique in the tech industry at large, and many security conferences exploit this curiosity for fun in the form of Capture The Flag (CTF) type problem solver games and various challenges. This year for OpenStack Summit we’ve built our own challenge for people to play. The main reason is because it’s just plain fun, but we also think it’s a great way to introduce people to the power of StackStorm. If you’re bent towards curiosity and if you are a hacker at heart, read on!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Minor update: v2.0.1</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2016/09/30/minor-update-v2-0-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2016 21:48:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2016/09/30/minor-update-v2-0-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sep 30, 2016&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

&lt;p>Hey folks, StackStorm v2.0.1 has been released, with a few small fixes and enhancements. We’ve also had some great code contributions recently, with a new integration for &lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog&lt;/a>, and improvements to our Github and Nagios packs.&lt;/p>

&lt;em>by Dmitri Zimine&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I set up a sensor to watch for a trigger (trigger represents an external event; sensor will fire a trigger-instance of the trigger type when the event is detected). I created a rule: if the trigger happens, and matches the criteria, it should fire an action. I see that event had happened. I expected the actions to fire. But it didn’t happen. Where did it break?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a long read, and may look complicated. But really, it’s just &lt;em>three debugging steps&lt;/em>. And it’s long because I refuse to write briefly, drop bunch of hints on the way and get you distracted. But as they say in math, the thicker the math book the faster it reads. &lt;strong>Brace yourself&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the example below, I’ll be showing you how we debugged our Twitter automation that scans tweets for mentions and posts it to Slack. A pretty good way to keep track on who is trash talking about us! The debugging “runbook” is generic and applies to troubleshooting other rules just fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, let’s look at the trigger chain and review how it works.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We love our users. We love them even when they report bugs. We love them &lt;strong>because&lt;/strong> they report bugs. But we &lt;strong>really, really&lt;/strong> love our users when they report bugs, along with complete configurations, how to reproduce the bug, and logs. Recently &lt;a href="https://github.com/bri365">Brian Martin&lt;/a> did just this, helping us resolve a tricky deadlock bug. Thank you Brian!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When you’re investigating a bug report, the first thing you want to do is to try to reproduce it. This helps you see what’s going on, and it gives you a clear test case to see if you’ve resolved it. Deadlocks &amp;amp; race conditions can be horrible bugs to work with, as they are often difficult to reproduce. They might depend upon your hardware resources, or what other jobs are running at the same time. Even reproducing it on the exact same setup is tough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Best thing about StackStorm?

But it’s not always enough. Sometimes you need a bit of help. Sometimes you think you’ve found a bug, and want to talk with the developers about it. That’s where our StackStorm community support can help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m sure you’ve heard us talk about our &lt;a href="http://stackstorm.com/community-signup">Slack channel&lt;/a>. It’s a great place for StackStorm users to get together, share ideas, and solve problems. But did you know that our Stormers are in this channel, and do their best to help support the community?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our engineers hang out here from 9:00 -&amp;gt; 17:00 PST, and often later. They’re happy to answer whatever questions you have. Just in the last few days, we’ve had questions about installation, ChatOps setup, writing sensors, purging history, creating actions, etc. Because the core engineers are involved in those discussions, not only can they help fix problems, they can also explain the design thinking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Network Automation with StackStorm and Docker</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2016/05/19/automating-docker-networking-with-stackstorm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2016 14:31:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2016/05/19/automating-docker-networking-with-stackstorm/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>May 24, 2016&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

&lt;p>What is StackStorm going to do with network automation? Ever since we joined Brocade, it’s been everyone’s question, and we have been hand-waving some answers. But the talk walks, code talks: let’s show something really working. Today’s example is on Docker network automation, where StackStorm makes physical networking follow Docker containers as they get created.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Millennial kids should watch my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9G71Ow6GUs">video with detailed explanations on StackStorm’s YouTube channel&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>True hackers might jump straight to &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/dockernetwork-vdx-demo">automation code on GitHub&lt;/a> to see how it is built and try it out on your StackStorm instance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Software is not done unless it is shipped to users and they can play around with something Tangible. For a feature or bug fix to be meaningful, the interested party has to get their hands on it, and decide if the new piece of code improves their life or reduces their pain. In this blog, I am going to tell you a fascinating story of us trying to ship a set of micro services to our customers, how we learnt from our initial mistakes and then describe our new approach to make you and us happier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason I am writing this particular blog post is twofold. I want:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>fellow nerds to learn from our experience and replicate our success, bypassing our initial mistakes, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to self reflect on where we went wrong and how we course corrected.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>These days ChatOps has become all the rage. In this blog I’ll talk a little bit about how we came to be here – in a leading position when it comes to ChatOps adoption for operations. And I’ll point you to some resources from users and our own engineers to learn more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The history lesson will be brief, I promise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started StackStorm after observing that existing solutions in the devops universe were generally point solutions, often evolved from scripts and other projects that DevOps engineers wrote to make their own lives easier. And that’s a great way to build a solution that appeals at least to those types of users for those specific use cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>What we saw was that while there were leaders within certain segments amongst those tools, there was no clearly adopted pattern for the wiring that tied all these tools together. Moreover, with our backgrounds in enterprises we knew that wiring together extremely heterogeneous environments is always a challenge. The enterprise is more a brownfield than a greenfield.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Fellow automators, we are happy to announce StackStorm 1.3. In this “Holiday release” (yes most of the work took place around the holidays) we took a break from “big features” and focused on addressing key learnings from extensive field usage, turning feedback from our expert users, and our own take aways from internal StackStorm use, into practical product improvements. The highlight of the release is a long-awaited ability to restart a workflow from a point of failure. We have been pushing it through for quite a while, first in upstream OpenStack Mistral, than exposing it via StackStorm, and now it’s ready for the prime time. With other highlights – making it easier to debug rules, track complex automation executions, and keep the history size under control – 1.3 release is a major step up in making StackStorm performant, operational and convenient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read on to learn about release highlights and what is coming up next.

&lt;p>Before moving to Openstack integration I’d like to post a short article about highly demanded feature, which is going to be implemented and supported natively out of the box by StackStorm one day, – Chatops Action Confirmation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, some actions, requested from chatops, may indeed be dangerous and typo errors or incorrectly entered values may harm your system or lead to unexpected, unpredictable and undesirable results. That being said, it would be really nice to ask the user who issued the command to confirm his or her intentions to execute it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So for now we have to do it on our own. And I’ll tell you what – it is not really difficult. We will examine two chatops aliases and I will elucidate on the things happening under the hood when these aliases are triggered.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stackstorm: from Nagios integration to Openstack automation</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2016/01/06/stackstorm-nagios-integration-openstack-automation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2016 01:17:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2016/01/06/stackstorm-nagios-integration-openstack-automation/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>January 07, 2016&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

&lt;p>Recently I’ve been playing around Stackstorm – a platform for integration and automation of day-to-day tasks, monitoring events, existing scripts and deployment tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to explain how easy it is to wrap your daily tasks into Stackstorm actions and workflows and how to provide a simple way of execution for complex tasks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been thinking for a while and initially I was going to bring everything up in one blog post. But later, it didn’t seem like a good idea. That being said, I’d rather break it into multiple posts, no matter how many there would be. Anyway, it seems to me that it’d be more practical and easier to read and understand.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="nagios">Nagios&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let’s start with integrating Nagios alerts into Stackstorm. Assuming that you already have Stackstorm version 1.2.0+ installed, configured and running, as well as there’s Nagios running somewhere else that is capable of processing alerts and handling events. If not, please, proceed to &amp;lt;www.stackstorm.com&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;www.nagios.org&amp;gt; (installation and initial configuration of these two tools is beyond the scope of this post). Both tools are open source and free to use and have extensive documentation on installation and basic configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, I was happy to find an existing Nagios integration pack &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-nagios">on StackStorm community repo&lt;/a>, but my joy ended really quickly as I found it not working.

&lt;p>StackStorm 1.2 features significant changes to ChatOps, some smaller improvements and plenty of bug fixes. Lets walk through some of the highlights –&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="chatops">ChatOps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The ChatOps changes are so extensive that we decided to dedicate a separate blog &lt;a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/12/08/stackstorm-1-2-0-the-new-chatops/">here&lt;/a>. Once users familiarized themselves with StackStorm-powered ChatOps we received excellent feedback which has been translated into some of the improvements in this release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The major theme is extending further your control of your ChatOps and especially what is presented in your precious chat real-estate.  We commercially support ChatOps – and we think improve it greatly versus rolling your own flavor of a bot or directly connecting more and more integrations to chat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we were at it we also took the liberty of reworking some StackStorm internals to better suit ChatOps needs thus enabling some of the features and opening up the door for many more future improvements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>StackStorm 1.2.0: the new ChatOps</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/12/08/stackstorm-1-2-0-the-new-chatops/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 15:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/12/08/stackstorm-1-2-0-the-new-chatops/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>December 8, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
&lt;em>by Edward Medvedev&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ChatOps — a concept where a chat bot acts as a control plane for your operations — has always been a core part of StackStorm. It adds context to your actions, automates routine tasks nobody likes, helps team members communicate better and learn from each other, and sometimes it’s just plain fun. If you’re new to this, check out the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37LmuHToYjQ">DevOps Next Steps talk&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://github.com/jfryman">James Fryman&lt;/a>, and if you’ve been writing Eggdrop scripts in IRC since you were five but never used it in your daily operations, you might also get inspired from the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw">ChatOps at GitHub talk&lt;/a> by Jesse Newland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we’re all excited to introduce — as a part of our &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v1.2.0">1.2.0 release&lt;/a> — a completely revamped ChatOps feature list. If you’re already using our Hubot integration to execute StackStorm actions from chat, stop doing whatever it is you’re doing and update! If not, it’s a good time to get started: ChatOps is the way of the future, now more than ever.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Build or Integrate Your Own Operational Dashboard w/ StackStorm (guest blog)</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/11/26/build-integrate-operational-dashboard-w-stackstorm-guest-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2015 21:08:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/11/26/build-integrate-operational-dashboard-w-stackstorm-guest-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>November 26, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

&lt;p>This tutorial will show you how to leverage the power of the StackStorm API to expose your fantastic new workflows built using the Flow (available to Enterprise Edition uses) by &lt;a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/02/tutorial-of-the-week-cassandra-auto-remediation/">following one of the blogs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our fictional scenario, we have built 2 complex workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Engage Tractor Beam, this workflow deploys some virtual machines to cloud, uses Hubot to notify the staff and then Puppet to drive the tractor beam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open/Close loading bay doors, this workflow takes the desired state of the doors to drive another workflow.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We want to provide our technical operations team with a really simple UI where they can just click these buttons and we hide the magic behind the scenes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="starting-off">Starting off&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First off, this is a tutorial for ASP.NET 4.5, MVC 5 and WebAPI 2.0, the latest Microsoft Web Development toolkit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to use another stack, you can follow the patterns here to repeat in another language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Opening up Visual Studio (here I am using 2013, 2015 would also work), select the ASP.NET Web Application template&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->This week two excellent engineers at Netflix spoke at the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Event Driven Automation meet-up&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->which Netflix hosted.  It was great to see old friends and thought leaders from Cisco, Facebook, LinkedIn and elsewhere. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->This blog summarizes Netflix’s presentation. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>My quick summary is that it was the best presentation I’ve seen that combines both solid reasoning about&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>&lt;em>why&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>to move towards auto-remediation as well as information about&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>&lt;em>how&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>to do so.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Before we get to all that substance, however, I should admit that my favorite moment of the evening was probably when they explained why Netflix calls auto-remediation based on StackStorm “Winston.” Remember Mr Wolf?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We’re really happy Sayli Karmarkar and Jean-Sebastien Jeannotte are joining in, willing to take all manner of automation, StackStorm and Netflix and specifically Cassandra (DataStax) questions.  As in “why don’t they talk auto remediation in House of Cards?”  haha.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sayli and JS are directly responsible for Cassandra (DataStax) operations at Netflix as well as building and running what they call Winston, their StackStorm based auto-remediation as a service offering at Netflix.  So come armed with Cassandra (DataStax) questions too.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A host is running out of disk space. What follows is a routine pager panic and rush in cleaning things up, at best. At worst, downtime. It is silly, but it happens much more than most of us care to admit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This, and many other annoying events like this can, and shall be auto-remediated. The “classic” pattern of wiring monitoring to and paging is simply not good enough, and know it when you’re paged at 3am to clean the disk on production server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And to those of you who hard-wire their remediation scripts into Nagios/Sensu event handlers, Splunk alert scripts and NewRelic web hooks: it is plain wrong there’s a better way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog, we show how StackStorm auto-remediation platform helps you hand out-of-disk case, with step-by-step walk-through and a working automation sample to kick-start your auto-remediation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tutorial of the Week: Cassandra Auto-Remediation</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/10/02/tutorial-of-the-week-cassandra-auto-remediation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 18:06:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/10/02/tutorial-of-the-week-cassandra-auto-remediation/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>October 2, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

&lt;p>This blog post will take you through the &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-octopusdeploy">integration pack for OctopusDeploy&lt;/a> and give you some example actions and rules to integrate with other packs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-octopusdeploy">What is OctopusDeploy?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.octopusdeploy.com">Octopus Deploy&lt;/a> is an automated deployment tool for .NET and Windows environments. It has gained significant popularity amongst the .NET development community for it’s ease of use and integration into the Microsoft development ecosystem. OctopusDeploy enables users to automate deployment of applications, packages and tools to Windows environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-integrate-octopusdeploy-into-stackstorm">Why integrate OctopusDeploy into StackStorm?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Octopus Deploy provides a rich system for Windows application deployments, but this is typically part of a wider DevOps process. Unlike StackStorm, it does not support closed-loop monitoring, remediation or infrastructure configuration and building, it does not integrate into configuration management tools (nor claim to). If you want to integrate OctopusDeploy from another tool, as part of a DevOps or environment tool you could&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>StackStorm 1.0 Enterprise Edition launched: w/ Netflix as user</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/09/22/stackstorm-1-0-enterprise-edition-launched-w-netflix-as-user/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2015 23:48:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/09/22/stackstorm-1-0-enterprise-edition-launched-w-netflix-as-user/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>September 23, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A StackStorm user with large investment in Java asked us: “Can I turn my Java code into StackStorm actions, and how?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is “&lt;strong>Yes you can&lt;/strong>, in three basic steps”:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Wrap the Java code in a Java console application;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take the input as command line arguments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the best results, output formatted JSON to stdout/stderr – this way StackStorm will auto-parse it so that you reference them with &lt;code>dotted.notation&lt;/code> in workflows.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>We are excited to announce another release of StackStorm. 0.13 comes with some great features, user contributions and many bug fixes. It’s definitely worth upgrading and the upgrade should be non-eventful.

&lt;em>by Evan Powell&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I tried to do when helping kick off the “software defined storage” craze some years ago was to define what we meant at Nexenta by that term.  A number of analysts in the space were positive about our clarity as were, more importantly, many users and partners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I realized that while we’ve blogged here and there about what we mean at StackStorm by auto-remediation, we have not directly posited a canonical definition of it.  People seem to grok that auto-remediation is a subset of event-driven automation however it is nigh time for us to have a single spot for our take on the definition.  With no further adieu, please read on and comment back here or via twitter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Auto remediation&lt;/strong> is an approach to automation that responds to events with automations able to fix, or remediate, underlying conditions. Remediation means more that simply clearing an alert; for example, it can mean ascertaining the scope of a problem through automated validation and investigation, noting the diagnosis of a problem in a ticketing system and very often in a chat system as well as in a logging system, and then taking a series of steps where each step’s completion or failure can be a prerequisite for the next step.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting Started With StackStorm and SaltStack</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/07/29/getting-started-with-stackstorm-and-saltstack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jul 2015 13:23:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/07/29/getting-started-with-stackstorm-and-saltstack/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Guest post by Jurnell Cockhren, CTO and Founder of &lt;a href="http://sophicware.com/">SophicWare&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-journey">Our Journey&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The task at hand is to connect Stackstorm to your pre-existing Saltstack infrastructure. Why? Well, by doing this you can turn all of your existing Salt actions into StackStorm actions, allowing you to use StackStorm for your overall event driven automation while Salt remains focused on remote execution and other use cases. This is a pattern we are increasingly seeing – so let’s try it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog covers both proper configuration of Saltstack NetAPI allowing for Stackstorm usage as well as how to install and configure the salt pack within StackStorm.

&lt;p>I’m extremely proud of the pace and quality of development ongoing here at StackStorm and in the broader community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets take a look at a couple of metrics that imperfectly capture the vitality of the project and the amount of development being done. If you look at the graph below you can see that the number of commits per month is quite similar to Docker and Ansible.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Insights from WebEx Spark’s talk at the OpenStack Summit on how they boosted operational agility&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I watched again the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->presentation&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> Reinhardt Quelle from Cisco Spark/ WebEx gave at the OpenStack Vancouver summit. It is an engaging presentation that covers a number of patterns, and a few anti patterns – everything from how they shifted their culture and org structure to Riak vs. Cassandra and PaaS vs. IaaS and much more besides.  StackStorm does get a positive mention, so I’m biased – but that’s just a small piece of what is a great talk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog I’ll give you the cliff notes and some pointers to dive into relevant sections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you find this interesting I strongly recommend that you invest 45 minutes to watch the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->original&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also – Reinhardt’s team will be co-hosting the upcoming &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Event Driven Automation Meet-up &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->in San Francisco at their offices July 29th.  Stop by to meet the team and dig in with them on these and other subjects.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reinhardt starts off by providing some context, beginning with the approach Cisco took to setting up Spark.  Leadership had already determined that trying to gradually evolve WebEx operations and development towards DevOps best practices was fraught with difficulty and likely to fail.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using StackStorm to Auto-Invite Users to a Slack Organization</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/06/30/using-stackstorm-to-auto-invite-users-to-a-slack-organization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 01:45:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/06/30/using-stackstorm-to-auto-invite-users-to-a-slack-organization/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>June 30, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

&lt;p>Slack is an amazing tool but sending invitations was a little bit of a pain point for us. So we figured (like we do), let’s automate it!

&lt;p>These days StackStorm is used in so many ways by users big and small from CI/CD through to auto scaling and auto remediation that sometimes the most basic of use cases can get over-looked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As folks like WebEx recently have explained, the first value they got out of StackStorm was pretty straight forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>StackStorm enabled them to pull together all their existing automations – i.e. scripts – and to have them managed in one place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a user put it:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>And with over 1500 integrations, whether those are north bound passive and active sensors, or south bound actions including full support for Salt, Ansible, Chef and Puppet, your own scripts can be augmented with a huge variety of additional colors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you know it you’ll be painting a beautiful picture. “That’s it, just some nice clouds here now.”&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>ChatOps brings the context of work you are already doing into the conversations you are already having. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jfryman&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>ChatOps is still a fresh and uncommon thing in the DevOps world, where work is brought into a shared chat room. You can run commands directly from chat and everyone in the chatroom can see the history of work being done, do the same, interact with each other and even learn. The information and process is owned by the entire team which brings a lot of benefits.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integrating ChatOps With StackStorm</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/06/12/integrating-chatops-with-stackstorm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2015 17:00:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/06/12/integrating-chatops-with-stackstorm/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>June 12, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With our recent announcement of our ChatOps integration and of our commercial support for ChatOps and ChatOps related dev ops professional services, we thought it would be fun to take a moment and share our insights into the design decisions that we made while developing this feature. Several core platform changes were introduced, including Action-Aliases and Notifications, to enable ChatOps. So, grab some popcorn, get cozy, and we let’s dive in!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A common request among users of the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->DripStat&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> APM is to get their alerts inside PagerDuty. Today we will show how using StackStorm, one can connect DripStat to PagerDuty.  So why bother using StackStorm? Well, StackStorm gives you thousands of integrations plus the ability to tie them together with a rules engine, workflow, audit, a GUI and CLI, API, and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>StackStorm is like an “If This, Then That” but for your operating environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once DripStat informs you that something has gone wrong with the system, you can use StackStorm to automate more and more of your responses to such events and conditions.

&lt;p>Last Friday we released full ChatOps support for StackStorm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how is this different than the countless other solutions that have announced, “you can Slack us”?  Slack has a huge ecosystem of integrations already.  And so does HuBot.  Why add StackStorm?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because with StackStorm based ChatOps you’ll:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>“Never” have to write another line of integration code again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tie an infinite library of automations and event sources to your chat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reuse rules, integrations, access control, audit and more across automations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alias commands simply – speeding user adoption.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I am pleased to announce the availability of our new platform feature, ChatOps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s true, yes. We have had ChatOps support for quite some time. However, a while back after receiving user feedback, we decided to give what we had built a good once over. To that end, ChatOps is dead. Long Live ChatOps! What we are releasing today is the result of these efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-chatops">What Is ChatOps?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ChatOps is a new operational paradigm where work that is already happening in the background today is brought into a common chatroom. In doing so, you are unifying the communication about what work should get done with actual history of the work being done. Deploying code from chat, viewing graphs from a TSDB or logging tool, or creating new Jira tickets are all examples of tasks that can be done via ChatOps.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New In StackStorm: Ansible Integration</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/06/05/new-in-stackstorm-ansible-integration/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jun 2015 17:28:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/06/05/new-in-stackstorm-ansible-integration/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>June 5, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We’re always happy when the number of integrations to StackStorm increases, creating bridges between more DevOps tools and extending possible use cases.  Our IFTTT for Ops approach – or Event Driven Automation – becomes more valuable the more ways to control and listen to your environment come pre-integrated, “batteries included.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, an &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ansible integration pack&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> was added to StackStorm Exchange, giving users the possibility to use Ansible as an underlying remote change and configuration management tool in conjunction with StackStorm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Your stories – and your ingenuity in wiring your environments together – have inspired us to build something truly different with StackStorm in order to help us all wire our environments together without incurring the massive technical debt of purely home built solutions. In the months since open-sourcing StackStorm late last year, the response has been almost overwhelming with downloads now in the tens of thousands per month, and recently doubling month over month over month.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this blog post, we cover CI part of CICD with Docker as an example. At a high level, this blog post will demonstrate how to create a docker image and push it to a registry on every commit to a github repo. You have probably read our own James Fryman’s excellent &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> on continuous delivery with StackStorm in a more traditional environment. If not, I highly recommend reading it. Also, this recent &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> from docker is a great introduction to using docker in continuous delivery. Before diving into the details, below is some motivation for switching to container based immutable infrastructure.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As Michael Dehaan of Ansible fame notes, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->immutable infrastructure is the way of the future&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Containers (especially, Docker) facilitate this by offering users a way to define their infrastructure through simple files (Dockerfile, for example). The role of orchestration tools changes when dealing with immutable infrastructure. A relevant quote from Michael Dehaan’s blog:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>by James Fryman&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time and time again, we hear of companies achieving rapid acceleration with DevOps. Companies are touting success with the metric of deploys/day, sharing new baselines of 10, 50 or even 100 deploys/day. In more mature organizations the likes of LinkedIn, Netflix, Etsy, Facebook and others, this number is a startling 1,000+ number. But, what does this even mean?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unpacking this number is often one IT leaders stumble on, and is the greatest source of pushback when talking about rapid acceleration. How stable is the software being delivered? How many of these deployments are successful? What constitutes a deployment?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These questions and more often end up creating analysis paralysis, and nothing changes. In fact, the most common response starts with, “There is no way we could implement something like that at my company because…” We know this to be false. Companies who have traditionally delivered in a waterfall fashion with a single, bloated deploy per month or quarter are successfully transitioning to rapid deployment posting similar baseline numbers as other teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How then can you be successful in beginning software delivery? There is no single silver bullet or magic wand, but there is a fairly prescriptive methodology for achieving our goal of rapid delivery. Let’s dive in and take a look on how to get started.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Event-Driven Automation Meetup Fun &amp; Filling.

&lt;p>Yesterday’s inaugural &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->event-driven automation meetup&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> was informative, and a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LinkedIn did a great job of hosting and accommodating us at the last minute, as reservations exceed expectations and a larger room, more pizza, and beer were needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was great to see friends from Netflix, HP, Facebook, Asurion, eBay, VISA and elsewhere in attendance. The questions were sharp and direct. As someone pointed out – “event-driven automation” is a relatively new space now getting tremendous attention as operators seek to compare notes on how they are boosting their operational agility through intelligent automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I strongly recommend the talks given by both Brian Sherwin and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dmitri Zimine&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brian’s talk got right into why and how LinkedIn built what they are calling Nurse. His talk was engaging and straightforward and Nurse itself is clearly extremely well thought through. Nurse has been designed to do remediations as simply as possible, with workflow and basic event handling included. While Nurse is relatively new and is being rolled out more broadly within LinkedIn, it already is handling some thousands of plans a week. It is run as a true Remediation as a Service in that the developers themselves – who are responsible for most of the ops of their code – utilize Nurse to save time and improve availability of their applications a pattern we also see frequently with StackStorm. LinkedIn has not yet open sourced Nurse; however, Brian indicated that they are interested in doing so.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Implementing ChatOps With StackStorm</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/05/01/implementing-chatops-with-stackstorm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2015 22:56:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/05/01/implementing-chatops-with-stackstorm/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>May 1, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>ChatOps is the methodology of bringing operations work that you are already doing into the context of the conversation you are currently having. Ultimately, leveraging ChatOps leads to increased transparency and democratized IT delivery. To achieve this, SMEs should codify their knowledge using a system such as StackStorm to help form that information so that it is consumable by everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out my &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/IhzxnY7FIvg">talk&lt;/a> discussing not only the philosophy behind and history of ChatOps, but also best practices for implementing and maintaining ChatOps in your environment.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The pace here never seems to let up, and in fact it just keeps accelerating, as Thursday we introduced the general release of &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->version 0.9&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> of StackStorm. The new release supports an important partnership with Microsoft and adds some new visual authoring tools in our new WebUI to simplify use of StackStorm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, as always, we are listening to you on IRC (&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->#stackstorm on Freenode&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and to our supported customers as well and constantly improving and fixing the platform itself.  Please take a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v0.9.0">release notes&lt;/a> to see all the details.&lt;/p>

As an aside, I’m absolutely flummoxed – in a good way – by the enthusiasm and professionalism and, yes, friendliness of the team we work with at Microsoft. I’ve dealt with pre anti-trust Microsoft and still carry scars from all those years ago. As many have pointed out, today’s Microsoft is a lot, lot different than in those days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you’ll note, we are not charging for StackStorm on Azure. We’re hopeful this will be another way for users to try out StackStorm without much friction. Note that Rackspace integration for StackStorm is of course strong as well and we have users running us on Digital Ocean and AWS of course as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weekly Update: Salt &amp; VictorOps Packs</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/04/24/weekly-update-salt-victorops-packs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 21:13:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/04/24/weekly-update-salt-victorops-packs/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>April 24, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>by Evan Powell&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our own James Fryman has written the foreword to a new book from VictorOps, titled &lt;em>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->ChatOps for Dummies&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/em>. The book is described as “a high-level guide to understanding the origins of the practice, the benefits and tools needed to get started, and important examples and tips to remember as you begin to explore ChatOps for your team.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What’s the connection between ChatOps and StackStorm, and why should you care? StackStorm is used as the automation platform underlying ChatOps implementations at companies as diverse as Rackspace and various large SaaS operators and financials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These users benefit from StackStorm running underneath the actual bot delivering the integration to chat – typically HuBot. Instead of having the chat client or the underlying bot as yet another integration to be wired together NxN across the environment, StackStorm users simply plug ChatOps into StackStorm and they have immediate access to the several hundred integrations already available in the StackStorm community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Via ChatOps, all of the systems into which StackStorm ties can be accessed – and can be automated. Also help, audit, redundancy and manageability are built into StackStorm, which further reduces the maintenance burden. Plus, users can actually “see” the execution of long running tasks, greatly simplifying troubleshooting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Actions Of All Flavors In StackStorm</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/04/20/actions-of-all-flavors-in-stackstorm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 13:00:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/04/20/actions-of-all-flavors-in-stackstorm/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>April 20, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>by James Fryman&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to unleash the true power of StackStorm, a good first step is to learn about actions. Actions are the cornerstone of the StackStorm system, representing what we commonly refer to as ‘lego bricks’. Actions are what StackStorm ties together to compose complex workflows to drive even the most complex cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we will explore actions within StackStorm. By the end of this article, you’ll have a great understanding of how…&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>to understand and create action metadata files.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and when to use each of the action runner types.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to create actions that execute code in any language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to create actions using native Python hooks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Ready to start your automation journey? Buckle up, and let’s dive in!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Return Of Workflows</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/04/10/the-return-of-workflows/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2015 17:43:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/04/10/the-return-of-workflows/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>April 10, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>This article originally appeared April 9, 2015 on &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevOps.com&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently workflows have emerged as a fundamental part of the operational wiring at companies as diverse as AWS, Facebook, HP, LinkedIn, Spotify, and Pinterest, which just &lt;a href="http://engineering.pinterest.com/post/113376157699/open-sourcing-pinball">open sourced Pinball&lt;/a>. We’ve witnessed a spike of interest in workflow-based automation, and a few interesting implementations coming to the open-source world in just the last year or two: &lt;a href="http://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mistral">Mistral&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TaskFlow">TaskFlow&lt;/a> from OpenStack ecosystem, &lt;a href="http://www.openscore.io/#/">Score&lt;/a> from HP, &lt;a href="http://data.linkedin.com/opensource/azkaban">Azkaban&lt;/a> from LinkedIn, &lt;a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi">Luigi&lt;/a> from Spotify, and &lt;a href="http://dray.it/">dray.it&lt;/a> by CenturyLink for the Docker ecosystem, to name a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Workflows are used to orchestrate operations in infrastructure and applications, automate complex CI/CD processes, coordinate map/reduce jobs, and handle jobs to containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not surprising that when it comes to higher level automation and orchestration, workflows are widely used. To quote the Pinterest blog: “In realistic settings it’s not uncommon to encounter a workflow composed of hundreds of nodes. Building, running and maintaining workflows of that complexity requires specialized tools. A Bash script won’t do.” Workflows are superior to scripts in concept and in practicality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rapid Integration Development With StackStorm</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/04/03/rapid-integration-development-with-stackstorm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2015 22:06:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/04/03/rapid-integration-development-with-stackstorm/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>April 3, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Day in and day out, the team at StackStorm is building tools that take away pain from the daily lives of Operations and Developers in IT Departments everywhere. We do this by focusing our efforts on absorbing all the Glue Code, the small snippets of code that tie together tools in your organization, and relieving the developer and operator of much of the traditional management overhead associated with automations. We also need to make sure that the tools we provide &lt;em>around&lt;/em> StackStorm are equally enjoyable and frictionless to use. To that end, I would like to share with you how to rapidly build integrations with our integrated development environment, &lt;code>st2workroom&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In a nutshell, StackStorm provides Event Driven Automation.

&lt;p>&lt;em>This article originally appeared on &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->New Relic’s blog&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am hard pressed to think of a challenge in operations today as complex as Infrastructure Autoscaling. In this single use case several unique subsystems must all play in concert to facilitate the delivery of computing resources with little or no human involvement. Done right, it is difficult to deny the magic of a workflow coming together to provide truly elastic infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the challenges in a real-world implementation of an autoscaling infrastructure are many, with one of the chief issues being a lack of flexibility. Many organizations have large investments in existing processes and technologies. When an autoscaling solution doesn’t allow for integration with a specific monitoring service, or users want additional control on how machines are managed, the end result is often to avoid the integration altogether or build custom code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All this being said, when &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> was approached by the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rackspace DevOps&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->organization to help solve for custom workflows, we jumped at the opportunity!

What I hope to share with you today is just how easy complex tasks like workflow automation can be tailored to your specific flavor of infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weekly Update: Dynamic Sensor Loading, Windows Integration And More Fun Packs</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/03/27/weekly-update-dynamic-sensor-loading-windows-integration-and-more-fun-packs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2015 22:21:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/03/27/weekly-update-dynamic-sensor-loading-windows-integration-and-more-fun-packs/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>March 27, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;h6 id="stackstorm-platform">StackStorm Platform&lt;/h6>
&lt;p>We’ve turned on authentication by default for package based deployments. In &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->st2express&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we have a simple file based auth as proof of concept. It might be a good time to read about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->setting up auth&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> in StackStorm. We also improved the sensor container to automatically load/unload/reload sensors on sensor model create/delete/update events. You can now simply write a sensor, register it with StackStorm and the sensor is picked up automatically. Perhaps it’s time for you to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->hack a sensor&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and contribute to our growing list of packs in our &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm Exchange&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> 😉 Look out for some of these features that will be rolled out as part of our 0.9 release.

&lt;p>The last couple of weeks we have hit an inflection point in that downloads are running at 5-7x February levels, IRC chats are getting more and more substantive, and folks like Rackspace and others are contributing to StackStorm (thank you! – let’s automate all the things – &lt;em>intelligently&lt;/em> – together :)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some highlights including a few events at which we attended and spoke:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One might think with all the efforts behind the 0.8 release, we’d take some much deserved time off — but alas, no such luck! There are too many important and exciting things to do around here. Without further ado, here is what we’ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h6 id="stackstorm-platform">STACKSTORM PLATFORM&lt;/h6>
&lt;p>With the 0.8 release out into the wild, we quickly pushed out a few patch releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>v0.8.1 – This was somewhat larger than expected for our first patch, but it included some scale improvements to support the brand new UI (have you tried it yet?). Then we got greedy and added a few more fixes while we worked on some patch mechanics. Bug fixes, scale improvements and some additive features.

&lt;p>DevOps is hot. Google Trends &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->confirms&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> that awareness of the term has exploded over the last eighteen months, and DevOps gurus like Gene Kim and Patrick Dubois — who is credited with coining the term DevOps — are becoming even more widely read and consulted by a range of companies.

&lt;p>And yet, as discussed in my last &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->article&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the barriers to enterprises achieving the kind of productivity boost that DevOps adoption promises are considerable and often non-obvious.

&lt;p>Since the above is inevitable, you want to ensure your infrastructure is set to automatically detect and deal with the above issues. Otherwise you &lt;em>are&lt;/em> looking at downtime sometime in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>IT is undergoing its most important shift in at least 20 years, and devops is at the core of this transformation. Devops is moving to the enterprise, but barriers to adoption still remain. Enterprises should take these challenges into account when they are attempting to achieve the enhanced agility that top operators have obtained.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, I discuss some of these under-appreciated barriers. In a subsequent article, I’ll dig into approaches I’ve seen effective in addresses these barriers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We’re off with a bang this week, starting to roll out several new core platform features, and showing off how StackStorm can integrate into systems of all types.&lt;/p>
&lt;h6 id="solutions">SOLUTIONS&lt;/h6>
&lt;p>We love showing off our platform, and this week we’re releasing the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery Canary Pipeline. How about that for a title? We’ve just been lovingly calling it ‘the canary’. The aim of showing this is to demonstrate the flexibility of StackStorm as it integrates into many different tools and workflows. The code itself is pretty opinionated about how it works, but much of this code is built to be reusable, and we’re including all of the infrastructure components necessary to build and deploy the pipeline itself so you can take a look. We’re hoping it gets your imagination going, so please &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->check it out&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and let us know your thoughts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>StackStorm 0.7 Is Here!</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/01/20/stackstorm-0-7-is-here/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2015 18:42:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/01/20/stackstorm-0-7-is-here/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>January 20, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sensors can be long running. If sensors are written to poll external sources (for example, we blogged about our &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter sensor&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->), it would be awesome to store state information in some place to de-dupe already processed events or even save markers (say, timestamps) to know what events have already been processed. Our “dogfooding” experience helped us take a user centric view and with that, we introduced a way for sensors to save state to key value store.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Continuous Integration And Delivery, The StackStorm Way</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/01/20/continuous-integration-and-delivery-the-stackstorm-way/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2015 18:33:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/01/20/continuous-integration-and-delivery-the-stackstorm-way/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>January 20, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There have been so many times when I have been on both the receiving end and giving end of this conversation, and it goes something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Me: Man, this awesome toolchain at Company &lt;em>X&lt;/em> really makes it easy to ship software!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Friend: How can I get my hands on that hotness!?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Me: Well…. um…&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And the conversation shifts… and the involved engineers begin discussing and sharing the good and bad about the toolchain, things that they want to do, how it’s helped… you get the idea. Unfortunately, the best that the receiver is going to get are the abstract ideas about these tools. Wonderful after-work discussion, but really horrible in actually helping share craft to make all of our jobs easier and more efficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s face it. If it’s difficult to share small code snippets with each other, forget about it when talking about trying to share entire process toolchains. Oftentimes, they are hyper-specialized to a specific company, tightly coupled with systems. There has to be a better way to share operational patterns while allowing for the tweaks and knobs that are unique to each company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a problem begging to be solved, and we’re taking a pass at it. And what better way to do that then to show off what can be done with StackStorm with a Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration Pipeline.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Managing AWS Instance Lifecycle With StackStorm</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/01/14/managing-aws-instance-lifecycle-with-stackstorm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2015 00:38:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/01/14/managing-aws-instance-lifecycle-with-stackstorm/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>January 13, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;h6 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h6>
&lt;p>The StackStorm community repo has a rich integration pack for EC2 and Route53 action that you can find inside the &lt;a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange&lt;/a>. These actions are incredibly useful but they are just the building blocks. The real power of using StackStorm actions comes when they are stitched together into workflows. I’ve taken the two basic workflows we use for EC2 instance lifecycle management and genericized them, then added them to the AWS integration pack. I’m going to go over how these can be used to greatly simplify creation and termination of instances.&lt;/p>
&lt;h6 id="why">Why?&lt;/h6>
&lt;p>At StackStorm we needed a way to rapidly provision VMs that had all of our bootstrapping done…and it had to be easy to do from the command line or StackStorm UI. This version of the workflow has been simplified to remove some of our internal bootstrapping steps but still reduces the entire process of instance creation, DNS registration, and basic bootstrapping to a single command.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weekly Update: New Year, New Content!</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/01/09/weekly-update-new-year-new-content/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2015 20:29:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2015/01/09/weekly-update-new-year-new-content/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>January 9, 2015&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At StackStorm, we want to enable our users to take advantage of everything our product has to offer, as well as provide feedback to us on the latest features as quickly as possible. In this spirit, we plan to share weekly updates regarding our progress, including new integration packs, improvements on existing packs, platform updates, and any tools created to help streamline the automation process. Our announcements will highlight both StackStorm-developed integrations as well as community contributions. We hope to be able to provide an overview of what has happened throughout the week as well as point out anything exciting that we see coming down the pipeline.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s been one month and 5 days since we open sourced StackStorm during the OpenStack summit in Paris. Since then, our team has had our heads down developing the software, checking off the items on the roadmap, and applying learnings from the field and feedback from community users to our product.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Moving to YAML for all content was the top ask from the community: many found dealing with JSON a bit cumbersome.

&lt;p>I’ve spoken at a couple of events, and chatted with hundreds of people at these events about an idea that has been swirling around in my head for a while now. This idea has gnawed at my subconscious throughout a big part of my career in IT Operations, but I was never really able to put my finger on what was bothering me. I just knew that lack of visibility and consistency in procedures drove me crazy. The opaque nature of action performed during an outage, or even a scheduled operation was frustrating. Post mortems were a nightmare of hazy memories, chat transcripts, and various permutations of ad hoc log parsing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>StackStorm – Automated Troubleshooting</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2014/11/25/stackstorm-automated-troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2014 05:32:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2014/11/25/stackstorm-automated-troubleshooting/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>November 24, 2014&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’ve done a couple articles about getting StackStorm set up, an introductory video, and put a fair amount of effort towards minimizing the barrier to entry for new users.  Overall, I think StackStorm was successful in providing a quick and easy way to get our system up and running but users need more than that.  Users need to see how StackStorm can help solve their specific pain points.  We needed a way to illustrate that we can provide an easy to use solution without the steep learning curve of throwing out your existing tools.  Over a series of a few blog posts we are going to go over some of the ways that we have leveraged the StackStorm platform internally and how these solutions could map to your environment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>StackStorm vs. AWS Lambda: Event-Driven Computing vs. Event-Driven Operations</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2014/11/20/stackstorm-vs-aws-lambda-event-driven-computing-vs-event-driven-operations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2014 20:08:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2014/11/20/stackstorm-vs-aws-lambda-event-driven-computing-vs-event-driven-operations/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the highlights of &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->AWS re:Invent&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, judging by the Twitter stream and the points emphasized in Amazon CTO Werner Vogel’s Day 2 &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->keynote&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, was the launch of Lambda.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->we are excited to announce the open-source availability of StackStorm&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, our operations automation software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>StackStorm ties together your existing infrastructure and application environment so you can more easily automate that environment — with a particular focus on taking actions in response to events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With StackStorm you define, and share – &lt;em>as code&lt;/em> – your operational patterns from events and triggers through to actions taken in response.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whether it is wiring together your continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) environments in a transparent way, or automating your troubleshooting and even remediation (including responses to security events, or any of the other common patterns you perform each day manually or with the help of siloed automation), StackStorm helps.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Date With StackStorm (Setup &amp; Action Library)</title><link>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2014/11/03/first-date-with-stackstorm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2014 04:53:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stackstorm.github.io/stackstorm.com/2014/11/03/first-date-with-stackstorm/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>November 3, 2014&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For this I’ll be using Virtualbox and Vagrant.  To use the same environment, just clone this repo:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->St2Express&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you do, you simply run:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>It takes a few minutes for this to fully provision, but one it does you can connect to the host with the vagrant ssh command.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Within the StackStorm &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->community repo&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> there is a script called metagenerator.py. If you run this script against an existing fabfile, it will generate all the necessary meta data to add the Fabric tasks into St2 as actions. Also included with this integration is an action needed to execute the actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get setup you need to clone this repo to somewhere on your machine:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Once you have the repo cloned, cd into fabric/actions&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>by Evan Powell&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>StackStorm connects events to actions you might want to take; and it does so through simple abstractions that allow you to reuse your approaches to managing events and to taking actions, including filtering events and applying rules and workflows. We call this sharing your &lt;em>operational patterns&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The approach of connecting events to actions is extremely extensible as events ranging from Nagios alerts to direct human interactions and actions from closing a ticket to interacting via our flavor of Hubot (“Stackbot”) can be tied together transparently, so they are easy to share, to manage and to control. Because of this flexibility, StackStorm solves many different problems for users, from helping with CI/CD through troubleshooting and remediation. And so StackStorm capabilities overlap to some extent with existing solutions. While we compare StackStorm to a number of such tools, StackStorm embraces the tool chain approach of DevOps operators.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
