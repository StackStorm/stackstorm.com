As a core member of our engineering team, you will take part in architectural design, creating and sustaining features for the platform and services, integrating with other platforms and supporting a lively and growing community. It&#8217;s a rare opportunity to understand the future work, &#8211; please look at the main repository [github.com/stackstorm/st2][2] with ~13K commits and ~150K lines of code.

An ideal candidate has 5-10 years of software engineering experience building distributed systems. If you have shown leadership in designing and architecting software systems and have a proven track record in executing and delivering value to customers, we are looking for you to join and help us in our vision towards automated remediation.

**Requirements:**

  * Experience with building secure, distributed and scalable systems
  * Experience with Python and/or other programming languages
  * Experience with designing REST APIs, working with SQL/NoSQL databases and messaging queues (other emerging technologies is highly desired)
  * Experience with continuous integration and continuous deployment is a huge plus

Apart from the above technical skills, following soft skills are desired:

  * Ability to work in a diverse and distributed team is highly desired
  * A self-starter that is passionate and motivated by new technologies and has empathy for legacy systems
  * A quick learner that can navigate through unfamiliar programming languages, systems and processes
  * Prior product building experience is optional but desired
