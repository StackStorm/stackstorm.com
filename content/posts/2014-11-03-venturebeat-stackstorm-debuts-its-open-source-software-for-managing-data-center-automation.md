The startup StackStorm is taking the first step toward popularizing the software it’s built to help people more efficiently run and update applications in whatever data centers they choose.

Today, in conjunction with the OpenStack Paris conference, StackStorm is releasing the 0.5 version of its software under an Apache open-source license, giving people a way to try it out and discover its capabilities.

And Evan Powell, StackStorm’s chief executive and a cofounder of the startup, is confident that when operations people take the software for a spin, they’ll be blown away. That’s because StackStorm can automatically run processes in data centers based on rules that people can set ahead of time, and these rules can then be sent out to others. Such features distinguish it from other data center automation tools.
