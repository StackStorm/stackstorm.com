Second to last month of the year, and updates to the [StackStorm Exchange][1] keep coming. New Terraform pack, major updates to Consul pack, and a bunch more updates. Read on for the details.

<!--more-->

## New Packs This Month

  * [Terraform][2] &#8211; are you codifying your infrastructure with [Terraform][3]? Check out the new actions for working with Terraform from StackStorm.
  * [Consul][4] OK, this is technically not a new pack, but it&#8217;s such a big overhaul of the old Consul pack that it might as well be. 9 new actions in this update. **Note:** If you are using this pack, pay close attention to the changes. Names have changed to make them consistent with the Consul APIs, and that might break your workflows.

## Pack Updates

  * [Zabbix][5] adds more actions, including the ability to change a node status, and change maintenance windows. 
  * [Network Essentials][6] now lets you send arbitrary configuration commands to Extreme VDX and SLX switches. 
  * [Device42][7]: New actions and rules for handling device lifecycles. Check out this Device42 blog on [working with Device42 and StackStorm][8].
  * [Jira][9]: New actions for attaching a file to an issue. Because who doesn&#8217;t want more Jira issues?
  * [Napalm][10] now lets you send some configuration commands, rather than having to specify a file.
  * [Excel][11] has been updated to support `float` and `int` keys and values. 

Thanks to all the contributors for their work. It means a lot to us.
