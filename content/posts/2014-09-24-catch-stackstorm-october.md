**September 24, 2014**

October is a busy month for us! We’re hosting a meetup in Palo Alto, exhibiting at DevOps Enterprise Summit and preparing for OpenStack Summit Paris – take a look at where StackStorm will be next month, and come by and say hello if you’re at any of these:

**San Francisco/Silicon Valley OpenStack Meetup:** On **Tuesday, October 14 at 6:30 p.m. PT**, StackStorm is hosting a SF/SV OpenStack Meetup, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Silicon-Valley-OpenStack-Meetup/events/206106642/" target="_blank">Automate all the Things! Nice motto – what options do we have in OpenStack?</a>, which will run through automation for OpenStack in all its forms. Led by our CTO, Dmitri Zimine, the meetup will review all Day 1 and Day 2 automation projects within OpenStack.

Dmitri is an expert in automation and has participated in many discussions with OpenStack operators, as well as, OpenStack forums and meetups. Prior to StackStorm, he was at VMware, where he led the vSphere Client team through four major releases and led a successful transition of vSphere Client to a new technology stack. During the meetup, Dmitri will provide an unbiased overview of automation projects including which projects are OpenStack specific, which are mature and which have momentum.

However, we don’t want Dmitri talking at you the whole time, we’d love to hear your feedback as well! So please come with an open mind, and if you’d like, with an opinion on which OpenStack automation project is your favorite and which you could live without.

The meetup will be held at the StackStorm headquarters – [395 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA][1]. We’ll also have drinks and snacks, with a networking hour, so you don’t want to miss this! <a href="http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Silicon-Valley-OpenStack-Meetup/events/206106642/" target="_blank">RSVP today</a>.

**DevOps Enterprise Summit 2014:** <a href="http://devopsenterprise.io/" target="_blank">DevOps Enterprise Summit</a> is a three-day event focused on bringing lean principles into the IT value stream, enterprise DevOps initiatives and continuous delivery. It’s a great opportunity to meet with members of the agile and DevOps community, and learn from industry thought-leaders on best practices for enterprise DevOps initiatives.

StackStorm is happy to be sponsoring and exhibiting at the event! We’d love to meet and talk about the third wave of operations automation, so tweet us @Stack_Storm or stop by booth TT1! DevOps Enterprise Summit is **October 21-23** in **Burlingame, CA**.

**OpenStack Summit Paris 2014:** StackStorm will be exhibiting at <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-paris-summit-2014/" target="_blank">OpenStack Summit Paris</a> this year! We are strong supporters of the OpenStack community and we can’t wait to fly out to Paris to meet with everyone and discuss what’s new in OpenStack.

We’ll be exhibiting at booth E2, and we look forward to seeing you there! OpenStack Summit Paris is **November 3-7** in **Paris, France**.
