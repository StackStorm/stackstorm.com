      For the re-launch group meet in November, it will be online (naturally), so make yourself comfy for an hour and a half and bring a favourite drink! We&#8217;ll have guest speakers from the StackStorm community and Technical Steering Community and others. As we get closer we&#8217;ll add an agenda. Expect an action packed first group meet as the interests wid&#8230;

<span>The agenda includes an intro about StackStorm Community, Demo oriented around AWS, some Q&As and free discussions about Automation and Orchestration. We plan to shout from the hills that StackStorm and Automation is alive, well and very much kicking. </span>

<span>It&#8217;s clear looking around the industry that the time of process, infrastructure and robotic process automation is now. This group aims to bring experiences and insight into what&#8217;s going on in the UK worth talking about!</span>
