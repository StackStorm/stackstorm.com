Many enterprises are delivering services to millions of customers every day, and one of their key challenges is to make sure they are never without service. Working at such a large scale requires organizations to streamline DevOps processes so they can minimize errors, reduce the burden on Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and get fast visibility into potential issues.

We are happy to welcome [Bitovi][2] as a partner. Just recently they helped one of their clients to streamline and solve DevOps automation using Stackstorm.

<!--more-->

The requirements for this solution included scalability, reliability, a pluggable architecture, and complex workflow creation. After evaluating several open source platforms as well as internal solutions the client had already built, they chose Stackstorm because it was the one that met all these requirements. In addition, it is event driven with a robust engine for IFTTT (If This Then That) and automatically diagnoses and remediates issues across domains.

In [their post][3], Bitovi gives more detail on what their team did to greatly reduce SRE fatigue, training costs, incident resolution errors, and incident resolution time by using StackStorm to automatically recognize common DevOps issues.

If you want to try Stackstorm, download it from our [webpage][4].
