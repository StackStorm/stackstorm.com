We’re looking forward to co-hosting next week’s OpenStack Online Meetup on July 17! Hosted by Rafael Knuth, OpenStack and Hadoop community manager and Stephen Spector, HP cloud evangelist, the meetup is a great forum to bring together the OpenStack IT community from across the world, to facilitate dialogue and share ideas, especially on new technologies.

In the meetup, our CTO and co-founder, Dmitri Zimine, will discuss automation approaches and projects within the OpenStack ecosystem. As we’ve mentioned [before][1], we’re big believers in OpenStack. It’s one of the largest open source projects in the world, and the community and corporate supporters of the community have made broad OpenStack adoption almost inevitable. We particularly like the OpenStack mantra “automate all the things.”

With the rise of OpenStack and similar approaches comes a more open environment comprised of loosely coupled components, each of which can be automated itself. Add the massive acceleration in the rate of change occasioned by agile and DevOps approaches to management and IT has an entirely new environment to manage. And automation is at the very core of current approaches to management.

We are not the only ones to notice that automation is important – there are over 20 automation projects within OpenStack alone that Dmitri will review and briefly explain, categorize, discuss and request your feedback. Dmitri has had years of experience with automation, being part of the “first wave of operations automation” brought on by Opalis (acquired by Microsoft) where he ran engineering. More recently he has become a core committer and co leader of the Mistral workflow as a service project within OpenStack; we have a short explanation [here][2] of that project.

The meetup will cover a variety of OpenStack automation tools, including Mistral, Heat, TaskFlow and Congress, and provide best practices, use cases and benefits of each. You can chat with us during the meetup but if you have any questions, feel free to submit them via Twitter @OpenStack_OM or IRC #OpenStack-Community @Freenode.

Below are some more details on how you can join the meetup. See you online!
