DevOps is all about the community movement – it’s an approach that is inherently collaborative. That’s why we love attending DevOps events and sharing ideas with others in the industry. <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-siliconvalley/program/" target="_blank">DevOps Days Silicon Valley</a> is around the corner and we’re expecting to see some great sessions. It’s the fifth anniversary for the conference, and we’re happy to be part of the program this year!

Patrick Hoolboom, an avid Stormer and contributor to our blog, will be presenting on the “10 Reasons Why DevOps is the Greatest Shift in the IT Industry.” There is a huge shift in IT towards a DevOps approach for building and operating software, with the goal of improving productivity. Conferences like DevOps Days are evidence of this shift and growth in the community.

The cloud brought a shift in power in IT organizations, and adoption has been on the upswing for the last few years. However, the cloud is only the infrastructure and to truly unlock its benefits, DevOps is an integral next step. At StackStorm we believe that it is truly the greatest shift in power the IT industry has seen in the last 20 years. Why? Well, we’ll save that for Patrick’s session at DevOps Days but if you aren’t attending, we look forward to sharing his presentation in the coming weeks.

Patrick’s session is at 12:15 pm this Saturday, June 28, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA. We hope to see you there!
