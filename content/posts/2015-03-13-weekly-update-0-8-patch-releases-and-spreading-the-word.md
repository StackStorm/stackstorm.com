One might think with all the efforts behind the 0.8 release, we’d take some much deserved time off &#8212; but alas, no such luck! There are too many important and exciting things to do around here. Without further ado, here is what we’ve been up to:

###### STACKSTORM PLATFORM

With the 0.8 release out into the wild, we quickly pushed out a few patch releases.

  * v0.8.1 &#8211; This was somewhat larger than expected for our first patch, but it included some scale improvements to support the brand new UI (have you tried it yet?). Then we got greedy and added a few more fixes while we worked on some patch mechanics. Bug fixes, scale improvements and some additive features. 
      * See <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v0.8.1" target="_blank">https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v0.8.1</a>
  * v0.8.2 &#8211; Targeted bug fixes in the action runner space. 
      * See <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v0.8.2" target="_blank">https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v0.8.2</a>

###### COMMUNITY AND CONTENT

  * **Mailgun Pack** &#8211; Lets you send out action via the Mailgun http APIs. Checkout the mailgun pack to send out emails as part of your workflows.
  * Lots of bug fixes and improvements in the <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/" target="_blank">StackStorm Exchange</a>. Some of these fixes are a fallout of making our packs compatible with 0.8 releases and some were improvements.

###### EVENTS

**Upcoming**

  * We plan to be at <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon15" target="_blank">SREcon15</a>, so if you are in the vicinity, come meet us at Booth #11.
