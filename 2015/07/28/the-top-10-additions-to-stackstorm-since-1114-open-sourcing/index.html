I’m extremely proud of the pace and quality of development ongoing here at StackStorm and in the broader community.
Lets take a look at a couple of metrics that imperfectly capture the vitality of the project and the amount of development being done. If you look at the graph below you can see that the number of commits per month is quite similar to Docker and Ansible. The source for this graph is OpenHub.Net

<p>I’m extremely proud of the pace and quality of development ongoing here at StackStorm and in the broader community.</p>
<p>Lets take a look at a couple of metrics that imperfectly capture the vitality of the project and the amount of development being done. If you look at the graph below you can see that the number of commits per month is quite similar to Docker and Ansible. The source for this graph is <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/compare?project_0=docker&amp;project_1=StackStorm&amp;project_2=Ansible&amp;submit_2=Go">OpenHub.Net</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another view of overall project vitality is the lines of code . Take a look:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(Incidentally, have we reached peak Docker?! – :))</p>
<p>And – what’s more – the most recent release, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm version 0.12<!-- raw HTML omitted --> – shows that the community is stepping up to help as well with commitments to core capabilities including managing actions (thanks Netflix), plugging in other workflow engines (thanks HP), and improving our ability to integrate with and control windows machines (thanks again <!-- raw HTML omitted -->James Sigurðarson<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>Meanwhile our core workflow engine, Mistral – which is upstream in OpenStack – is itself gathering more contributors.  We make Mistral much easier to use and more useful by tying it into the overall StackStorm platform to deliver event driven automation.</p>
<p>All of this progress caused me to want to take a step back and parse this progress a bit.  Yes, we see much more code and contributions hitting the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm community<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  But – so what?</p>
<p>Just as I recently reviewed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->top 10 how to blogs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in terms of traffic over the last several months I thought it worth reviewing the top 10 features and capabilities added in the last several months as well.</p>
<p>What’s changed?  What is inside that line up and to the right?  And what do you think?</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s take a look at those top 10 improvements, some of which will be obvious and others of which you may want to click through to better understand.</p>
<h3 id="1-gui">1.  GUI</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="2-native-chatops-support-chatops-simplified-and-improved">2.  Native ChatOps support:  ChatOps simplified and improved</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="3-visual-design-of-rules">3.  Visual design of rules</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="4-rules-should-be-part-of-a-pack-and-other-content-management-improvements">4.  Rules should be part of a pack and other content management improvements</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="5-windows-support">5.  Windows support</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="6-variety-of-cli-improvements">6.  Variety of CLI improvements</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="7-pluggable-authentication">7.  Pluggable authentication</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="8-no-dependency-hell-for-integration-packs">8.  No dependency hell for integration packs</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="9-salt-ansible-chef-and-puppet">9.  Salt, Ansible, Chef and Puppet</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="10-docker-deployment-and-more-options">10.  Docker deployment and more options</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So you know I’m incredibly proud of the progress of the StackStorm code base.  We are really cranking.  And I think the above is a decent summary of recent progress.  However – what do you think?  What would you like have seen?</p>
<p>Care to help order or add to our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->roadmap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?  Please do dive in and let us know what you’d like to see.  We now have many tens of thousands of downloads and yet we only hear from, well, many of you but not as many as we’d like.  If you are part of the silent majority, tell us on Slack (register <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for public channel) or even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@Stack_Storm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> how we are doing and what you’d like us and the community to work on next!</p><ul class="pa0">
