I’m extremely proud of the pace and quality of development ongoing here at StackStorm and in the broader community.
Lets take a look at a couple of metrics that imperfectly capture the vitality of the project and the amount of development being done. If you look at the graph below you can see that the number of commits per month is quite similar to Docker and Ansible. The source for this graph is OpenHub.Net

<p>I’m extremely proud of the pace and quality of development ongoing here at StackStorm and in the broader community.</p>
<p>Lets take a look at a couple of metrics that imperfectly capture the vitality of the project and the amount of development being done. If you look at the graph below you can see that the number of commits per month is quite similar to Docker and Ansible. The source for this graph is <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/compare?project_0=docker&project_1=StackStorm&project_2=Ansible&submit_2=Go">OpenHub.Net</a></p>
<p>Another view of overall project vitality is the lines of code . Take a look:</p>
<p>(Incidentally, have we reached peak Docker?! – :))</p>
<p>And – what’s more – the most recent release, StackStorm version 0.12 – shows that the community is stepping up to help as well with commitments to core capabilities including managing actions (thanks Netflix), plugging in other workflow engines (thanks HP), and improving our ability to integrate with and control windows machines (thanks again James Sigurðarson).</p>
<p>Meanwhile our core workflow engine, Mistral – which is upstream in OpenStack – is itself gathering more contributors.  We make Mistral much easier to use and more useful by tying it into the overall StackStorm platform to deliver event driven automation.</p>
<p>All of this progress caused me to want to take a step back and parse this progress a bit.  Yes, we see much more code and contributions hitting the StackStorm community.  But – so what?</p>
<p>Just as I recently reviewed the top 10 how to blogs in terms of traffic over the last several months I thought it worth reviewing the top 10 features and capabilities added in the last several months as well.</p>
<p>What’s changed?  What is inside that line up and to the right?  And what do you think?</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s take a look at those top 10 improvements, some of which will be obvious and others of which you may want to click through to better understand.</p>
<h3 id=1-gui>1.  GUI</h3>
<h3 id=2-native-chatops-support-chatops-simplified-and-improved>2.  Native ChatOps support:  ChatOps simplified and improved</h3>
<h3 id=3-visual-design-of-rules>3.  Visual design of rules</h3>
<h3 id=4-rules-should-be-part-of-a-pack-and-other-content-management-improvements>4.  Rules should be part of a pack and other content management improvements</h3>
<h3 id=5-windows-support>5.  Windows support</h3>
<h3 id=6-variety-of-cli-improvements>6.  Variety of CLI improvements</h3>
<h3 id=7-pluggable-authentication>7.  Pluggable authentication</h3>
<h3 id=8-no-dependency-hell-for-integration-packs>8.  No dependency hell for integration packs</h3>
<h3 id=9-salt-ansible-chef-and-puppet>9.  Salt, Ansible, Chef and Puppet</h3>
<h3 id=10-docker-deployment-and-more-options>10.  Docker deployment and more options</h3>
<p>So you know I’m incredibly proud of the progress of the StackStorm code base.  We are really cranking.  And I think the above is a decent summary of recent progress.  However – what do you think?  What would you like have seen?</p>
<p>Care to help order or add to our roadmap?  Please do dive in and let us know what you’d like to see.  We now have many tens of thousands of downloads and yet we only hear from, well, many of you but not as many as we’d like.  If you are part of the silent majority, tell us on Slack (register here for public channel) or even @Stack_Storm how we are doing and what you’d like us and the community to work on next!</p><ul class=pa0>
