Time flies.
Over two years ago we got StackStorm going.  And today we announce the general availability of StackStorm, both the Enterprise Edition and the Community Edition.  
We have made StackStorm generally available because it is now ready, having proven itself at Netflix, WebEx and with thousands of other users.  Maybe more importantly, we are announcing general availability because we are ready, with commercial license subscriptions, 24×7 support, and more.  
We’ve learned a lot over the last couple of years thanks to countless conversations with automators and operators and thanks to discussions amongst what I strongly believe is the best core technical team in the overall DevOps market.  All that learning shows up in StackStorm – a solution that is different than earlier automation in a number of ways:

<p>Time <em>flies</em>.</p>
<p>Over two years ago we got StackStorm going.  And today we announce the general availability of StackStorm, both the Enterprise Edition and the Community Edition.  </p>
<p>We have made StackStorm generally available because it is now ready, having proven itself at Netflix, WebEx and with thousands of other users.  Maybe more importantly, we are announcing general availability because <strong>we</strong> are ready, with commercial license subscriptions, 24×7 support, and more.  </p>
<p>We’ve learned a lot over the last couple of years thanks to countless conversations with automators and operators and thanks to discussions amongst what I strongly believe is the best core technical team in the overall DevOps market.  All that learning shows up in StackStorm – a solution that is different than earlier automation in a number of ways:</p>
<p>Well, those are at least some of the reasons that StackStorm has emerged as a leader of event-driven automation.  Take it out for a drive – with StackStorm 1.1 we are releasing an improved all in one installer that includes a GUI if you are so inclined and that will install either the Community Edition or the Enterprise Edition.     </p>
<p>Just go to <a href=http://docs.stackstorm.com/install/all_in_one.html>http://docs.stackstorm.com/install/all_in_one.html</a>. Please note that to grab Flow – and other Enterprise Edition capabilities – you’ll need to register on our front page and you’ll get an automated email with once again a link to this installer and, importantly, a license key to unlock those capabilities.  </p>
<p>Lastly – what’s next?  We will be accelerating our development now and next year will be releasing a piece of software that we believe changes the game for operations – again. Maybe more important than that big bang will be the day to day to day work to make <em>every user successful</em>.  Find us on our community, ask us questions, and help us incrementally improve StackStorm.</p>
<p>Finally – I’m now talking to dozens of users and would be partners or competitors, all of whom are struggling with build vs. partner decisions.   You have a tough decision to make, do you struggle on with your existing solution or do you “pull a Netflix” and bet on StackStorm.   At they put in their talk at the Cassandra Summit, with StackStorm you get both a vendor committed to your success and a community adding capabilities to StackStorm and removing the specter of vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll join us. Together we are making the sort of transformative efficiencies and agility delivered by event driven automation like Facebook’s FBAR available for all of us.</p>
<p>PS – <em>a shout out to our friends at PagerDuty and VictorOps – how do you make getting paged at 2am suck less?  You make sure you don’t get paged in the first place!</em></p><ul class=pa0>
