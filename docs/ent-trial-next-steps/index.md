Thank you for test driving Extreme Workflow Composer!

EWC gets you all the goodness of StackStorm, plus Design UI for drag and drop design of automations, RBAC, LDAP and, maybe most importantly &#8211; a taste of our enterprise level support.

## Your Next Steps

Please check your e-mail: you will receive your **license key** to the email address submitted on the form.

EWC is installed as an addition to the StackStorm open source. Choose the installation steps for your OS: <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/deb.html" target="_blank">Ubuntu / Debian</a>, <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/rhel7.html" target="_blank">RHEL 7 / CentOS 7</a>, or <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/rhel6.html" target="_blank">RHEL 6 / CentOS 6</a>. Run through the instructions, and make sure you follow the last step: _Upgrade to Enterprise Edition_.
