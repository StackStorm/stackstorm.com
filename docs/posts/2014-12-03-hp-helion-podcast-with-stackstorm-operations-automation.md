At the recent OpenStack Summit in Paris, I had a chance to meet with <a href="http://stackstorm.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">StackStorm</a>, a software operations automation company who <a href="http://stackstorm.com/2014/11/03/press-release-stackstorm-launches-open-source-software-to-improve-operations-automation/#more-1603" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announced</a> the release of StackStorm 0.5, open source software for operations automation.  I recorded a Podcast with their CEO and technology evangelist.
