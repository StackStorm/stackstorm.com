  <span>In recent news </span><a href="https://stackstorm.com/2020/05/27/extreme-networks-donates-ewc-to-linux-foundation/"><span>Extreme Networks open-sourced EWC</span></a><span> and contributed all previously “enterprise only” features to the StackStorm project operating under the Linux Foundation.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <span>This is very exciting news for the project’s future and its users. It also means that StackStorm’s destiny now rides on the shoulders of the community along with organizations that rely on it in their production infrastructure and benefit from the project’s unique event-driven-automation and automated remediation capabilities.</span><!--more-->
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <span>StackStorm includes a lot of components that makes it an amazing and complete platform: </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2"><span>st2</span></a><span> core platform, st2 plugins and modules, </span><a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/"><span>documentation</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/"><span>StackStorm Exchange</span></a><span> with the </span><span>150</span><span>+ integration packs,</span> <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2docs"><span>Web UI</span></a><span>, the </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/orquesta"><span>Orquesta workflow engine</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2-packages"><span>deb/rpm packages</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2ci"><span>CI</span></a><span>/</span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2cd"><span>CD</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2chatops"><span>ChatOps</span></a><span>, internal infrastructure and a number of deployment methods like </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/puppet-st2"><span>Puppet</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/chef-stackstorm"><span>Chef</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2"><span>Ansible</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/docker.html"><span>Docker</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/stackstorm-ha"><span>Kubernetes</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/vagrant.html"><span>Vagrant</span></a><span> as well as our </span><a href="https://forum.stackstorm.com/"><span>Forum</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://stackstorm.com/community-signup"><span>Slack Communities</span></a><span>. This is maintained by a small team of enthusiasts during their free time.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <span>The </span><a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/blob/master/OWNERS.md"><span>StackStorm team</span></a><span> takes the project quality seriously. A quick example, every time someone opens a new PR against </span><a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2"><span>StackStorm/st2</span></a><span> Deb/RPM packages are built, uploaded to Apt/Yum repositories and verified end to end in different testing scenarios by creating a temporary VM instances in the cloud for every OS platform we support (currently 5 OS flavors). This is powered by </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2tests"><span>st2tests</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2ci"><span>st2ci</span></a>,<span> and </span><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2cd"><span>st2cd</span></a><span> workflows running on a StackStorm cluster in AWS. We also </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food"><span>eat our dog food</span></a><span> and find ways to improve the StackStorm via nightly builds, package promotion workflows, staging/unstable/production environments, and </span><a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/discussions/wiki/Release-Process"><span>release process</span></a><span> that encompasses testing all the components thoroughly before our users download new versions.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <span>But there are many other pieces used behind the scenes of the StackStorm project besides just the AWS cloud and computing resources. StackStorm relies on a number of external paid services to function well: we use </span><a href="https://packagecloud.io/"><span>PackageCloud</span></a><span> for hosting our </span><a href="https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm"><span>Deb/RPM package repositories</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.discourse.org/"><span>Discourse</span></a><span> to allow you get help through </span><a href="https://forum.stackstorm.com/"><span>forum.stackstorm.com</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://circleci.com/gh/StackStorm"><span>CircleCI</span></a><span> for automated testing, </span><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/"><span>G Suite</span></a><span> for administrative emails, </span><a href="https://zoom.us/"><span>Zoom</span></a><span> for the monthly </span><a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/discussions/issues/33"><span>TSC meetings</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://stackstorm.com/"><span>stackstorm.com</span></a><span> domain SSL certificates, etc. The full list is highlighted in the </span><a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/discussions/issues/36"><span>StackStorm Expenses</span></a><span> document.</span>
</p>

<span>Now that StackStorm is fully independent and backed by its community of users we are happy to announce that StackStorm has established a way to accept monetary donations through the Linux Foundation’s </span><span>Community Bridge</span><span>.</span>

  <span>The Community Bridge platform provides transparency around funds usage and reporting, establishes trust and enables the community to </span><span>support the StackStorm project</span><span>. We’re very excited to see recent movement around fixing the economy behind Open Source with new platforms and also adding a Github “Sponsor” button to all StackStorm project repositories. </span><span></span><span> <span id="docs-internal-guid-c09229d1-7fff-87b0-d8fd-ff765ccdcdda"></span></span>
</p>

<span>Moving forward we will need contributions in order to help covering StackStorm maintenance, infrastructure expenses, development, bug fixes, security researches, timely security patches, spreading the word via meetups, developer conferences, marketing and any other initiatives that would make StackStorm successful. Please show your appreciation to the StackStorm team&#8217;s dedication, hard work, and value that StackStorm as a tool provides and time it saves in your day to day work by donating to the project via </span>[<span>Community Bridge Sponsorship platform</span>][3]<span>.</span>
