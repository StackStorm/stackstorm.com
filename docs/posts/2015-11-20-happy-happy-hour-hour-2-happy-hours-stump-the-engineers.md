<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday the 1st at 10am we’ll be talking event driven automation and specifically auto-remediation with our friends at Netflix.</span>

We’re really happy Sayli Karmarkar and Jean-Sebastien Jeannotte are joining in, willing to take all manner of automation, StackStorm and Netflix and specifically Cassandra (DataStax) questions.  As in &#8220;why don&#8217;t they talk auto remediation in House of Cards?&#8221;  haha.

Sayli and JS are directly responsible for Cassandra (DataStax) operations at Netflix as well as building and running what they call Winston, their StackStorm based auto-remediation as a service offering at Netflix.  So come armed with Cassandra (DataStax) questions too.

  <span style="font-weight: 400;">To register for the Happy Hour, please go to </span><a href="http://www.stackstorm.com/register"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.stackstorm.com/register</span></a>
</h4>

As you’ll see the format is a Google Hangout.  Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/DoriftoShoes" target="_blank">DoriftoShoes</a> (aka &#8220;Patrick&#8221;) will take questions as well &#8211; you can share them then via the hangout once it starts or via twitter through #AskAnAutomator.  Feel free to bring your #badauto scenarios as in &#8220;a friend of mine said one time their automation pulled all their servers out of the queue on Cyber Monday.&#8221;  Or, &#8220;my ChatBot keeps telling jokes that are not humorous.&#8221;

<!--more-->

We will also take questions via the StackStorm community on Slack.  If you have not already joined that community, please do so. To request an invite go:  <a href="http://stackstorm.com/community-signup" target="_blank">stackstorm.com/community-signup</a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, December 15th at 11am Pacific, &#8220;Patrick&#8221; will be joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonypjshaw" target="_blank">Anthony Shaw,</a> innovation lead at </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dimension Data ITaaS</span>][1]<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Anthony is an active StackStorm community member helping StackStorm and Dimension Data offer joint solutions including ChatOps enabled self-management of complex clouds with much more to come.</span>

You can register for this version of the Happy Hour (and learn a bit more about it), here:

</p>

Dimension Data is one of the largest integrators in the world.  And they are also perhaps the leading provider of hosted Microsoft software &#8211; think Office365+ functionality run in your private cloud.  Anthony’s contributions include improved StackStorm integrations with Windows PowerShell and related pieces of the ecosystem such as <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/01/octopusdeploy-integration-with-stackstorm/" target="_blank">OctopusDeploy </a>and Yammer.  I&#8217;m really looking forward to trying to stump Anthony; he knows StackStorm very well AND he works day to day with national governments and other Dimension Data customers on their transition to the cloud.  Fascinating perspective IMO.

In short &#8211; please register for our upcoming Happy Hours and come armed with questions about how and why to leverage StackStorm to address your automation challenges as well as any other questions you might have about the remediation and automation requirements and approaches of Netflix and DimensionData.
