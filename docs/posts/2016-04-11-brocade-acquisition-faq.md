## Directions and Roadmap

**Q: What will happen with StackStorm open-source project?  
**  
**A: No change:** StackStorm automation platform will continue to be actively developed, and stays open-source under Apache 2.0. StackStorm Community product remains available as a free download.

**Q: How will the transition affect StackStorm roadmap?  
**  
**A:** We will continue to (1) enhance the core StackStorm automation platform by <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/roadmap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the current roadmap</a> and (2) to build cross-domain integration packs. Both solid event driven DevOps automation base product, and breadth and depth of integrations with wide variety of datacenter tools, products and cloud platforms are essential to Brocade.  
In addition, we will focus on networking use cases, adding network specific integrations and automations on top of StackStorm core automation.

**Q: Will the focus on networking mean less functionality for event-driven automation?  
**  
**A: No.** Networking automation is an extension of core automation platform to a specific domain. A stable, usable, performing platform, and rich set of cross-domain integration packs are as critical to Brocade network automation as to many other StackStorm applications, be it Continuous Deployment, Security, remediating Cassandra or ELK, IOT home automation or genome computation (hi <a href="http://arteria-project.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project Arteria</a>).

We encourage community to continue building diverse solutions on top of StackStorm IFTTT-like platform, and ensure you that with more future certainty and more resources the platform will serve a solid foundation for your use cases.

**Q: What about ChatOps? StackStorm has been the first product implementing ChatOps out of box, will it continue?  
**  
**A:** We will continue to lead ChatOps space and build up our in-product support for it. We see ChatOps as a catalytic ingredient of DevOps; with Brocade direction to apply DevOps style automation to Networking, ChatOps remains a focal point in our product strategy. Stay tuned for some cool improvements in ChatOps.

## Community and Customers

**Q: What will happen to StackStorm community?

**A:** First we want to say thank you for your continued support and contributions &#8211; we couldn’t have done it without you!

**Q: What will happen to StackStorm paying customers?

## Enterprise Edition and Commercial Offerings

**  
**A:** Commercial offering of StackStorm Enterprise is suspended and not available for purchase. A free trial of StackStorm Enterprise remains available for download.

**Q: Will a commercial offering of StackStorm be available in the future?

Yes you can access all enterprise components via free trial download of StackStorm Enterprise. We will gladly grant a trial extension on request.

**Q: Did you consider open-sourcing Flow, or other proprietary StackStorm components?  
**

**Q: How can I get support?
