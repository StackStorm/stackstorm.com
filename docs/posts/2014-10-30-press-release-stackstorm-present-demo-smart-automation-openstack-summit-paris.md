PALO ALTO, Calif.&#8211;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#8211;StackStorm, a software company leading the third wave of operations automation, today announced it will present on “Automating OpenStack/AWS Environments without Technical Debt” in the Sponsor Demo Theater at OpenStack Summit Paris on November 4. During the demo, Evan Powell, co-founder and CEO of StackStorm, will explore how to leverage StackStorm automation software in OpenStack and AWS environments.

“If you are not careful, the automation you write to speed things up can become technical debt that slows you down,” said Powell. “The StackStorm software we are open sourcing and demoing helps users better integrate, author, manage and scale their automation. This enables them to avoid the creation of technical debt and experience the benefits of a highly automated environment in CI/CD, troubleshooting, remediation, security event management and more.”
