Today we are happy to announce StackStorm v2.10.4.

This is another bug fix release in the v2.10.x release series. It includes the following bug fixes and improvements:

  * Fix inadvertent regression in notifier service which would cause generic action trigger to only be dispatched for completed states even if custom states were specified using `action_sensor.emit_when` config option. 
  * Make sure we don&#8217;t log auth token and api key inside st2api log file if those values are provided via query parameter and not header (`?x-auth-token=foo`, `?st2-api-key=bar`). 
  * Fix rendering of `{{ config_context. }}` in orquesta task that references action from a different pack 
  * Add missing default config location (`/etc/st2/st2.conf`) to the following services: `st2actionrunner`, `st2scheduler`, `st2workflowengine`. 
  * Update statsd metrics driver so any exception thrown by statsd library is treated as non-fatal.

## Upgrading

As always, make sure you have backups first. Then follow the standard&nbsp;[Upgrade Instructions][1].
