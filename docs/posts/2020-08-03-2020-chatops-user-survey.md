**August 3rd, 2020  
** _by [@blag][1]_

The 2020 ChatOps User Survey is [here][2]! This is your chance to submit your feedback on using ChatOps with StackStorm &#8211; what we get right, what we get wrong, and what we need to focus on.

We will use this feedback to chart the development roadmap for ChatOps, whether that means leaving st2chatops as-is, or focusing on supporting more chat providers, deeper feature support for specific providers, improving ChatOps integration with the rest of StackStorm (RBAC for ChatOps!), or even [rewriting the entire thing on top of Errbot][3] or OpsDroid.

Your feedback is valuable to us, especially now that [all of StackStorm is open source][4], since it will allow us to cater our efforts towards what matters the most to you. Are you running ChatOps as a hubot plugin to your own hubot instance? Have you extended ChatOps to use your own chat provider? Are you running a different ChatOps service? Do you want to use machine learning driven artificial intelligence to securely empower natural language understanding and disrupt established technology while creating a digital transformation and revolutionizing paradigms in the cloud on the blockchain? We want to hear from you!

Please take a few minutes out of your day to fill out 2020 ChatOps User Survey and/or leave us a kind note or some words of encouragement. The survey will close at noon (PDT) on August 31st, so leave your feedback soon!

The survey is here:

Once you&#8217;re finished, you can also help us out by [sponsoring the StackStorm project][5] and [contributing code][6].
