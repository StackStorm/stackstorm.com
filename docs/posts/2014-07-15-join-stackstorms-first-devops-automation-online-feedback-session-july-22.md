**July 15, 2014**

At StackStorm, our mission is to lead the third wave of operations automation and enable everyone to achieve the 10-100x productivity improvements that highly automated DevOps operators achieve. We’ve been in private beta for more than a month now, and think it’s time to share our story with DevOps and IT communities.

On Tuesday, July 22, we will host our first interactive web meeting focused on DevOps automation, and we welcome your participation! Our CEO, Evan Powell will host the meeting, discussing topics such as common DevOps automation patterns, fundamentals of DevOps architectures and infrastructure as code. Evan will also introduce StackStorm’s software and give his thoughts on the future of self-driving data centers.

Evan will be joined by lead DevOps Stormer, Patrick Hoolboom, who most recently led DevOps efforts at Cloudmark and who is an experienced speaker at events like the recent DevOps Days Silicon Valley. Together, Evan and Dmitri will tell StackStorm’s story, request direct feedback from you, and answer any questions you may have.

DevOps and OpenStack prove that communities move markets, and as Stormers, we are proud supporters of both! We believe our online feedback session will provide the perfect platform to facilitate this collaboration by offering an opportunity for members to share thoughts and ideas.

You can register for the web meeting by clicking the links below. We’ll be holding a second session on Thursday, July 24, so you’ll have two opportunities to join us.

We’re looking forward to speaking with you!
