  Yesterday, <a href="http://stackstorm.com/" target="_blank">StackStorm</a> announced the release of StackStorm 0.5, an open source software solution for operations automation. To find out more about the company and the new release, I spoke with Evan Powell, co-founder and CEO.

  <em><strong>Evan Powell: </strong></em> Dmitri Zimine, the former director of R&D and cloud infrastructure at VMware, and I founded StackStorm in 2013 with the vision of creating a truly self-driving data center. StackStorm is sometimes described as <i>the wiring for your Legos</i> &#8211; tying together and making sense out of the many loosely coupled components of today&#8217;s IT environments. Since coming out of stealth in May, our software has been available in private beta and we&#8217;ve learned a huge amount about both the power of operations automation and the challenges to its adoption. Now, we are thrilled to open source StackStorm 0.5, which encapsulates much of what we have learned [&#8230;]
