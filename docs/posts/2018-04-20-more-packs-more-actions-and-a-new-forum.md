We&#8217;ve got a few things to cover here &#8211; firstly we have a new [forum][1] for seeking help and sharing ideas, and we have good bunch of recent updates to [StackStorm Exchange][2] packs. There&#8217;s new packs for Redis & Kayako, and updates to the Slack, Email, Jira, and Palo Alto packs. Here&#8217;s the details:

## New Forum!

You know we love [Slack][3]. But sometimes Slack isn&#8217;t the best choice. Conversations are ephemeral, Google doesn&#8217;t index them, and sometimes the person who knows the answer just isn&#8217;t online at that time. So we&#8217;ve created [forum.stackstorm.com][4]. Slack is still very much in use, and is great for real-time conversations, but the forum is better for things that will stay around &#8211; e.g. FAQs and How-tos.

## New and Updated Packs This Month

  * [Palo Alto][6]: [@lampwins][7] has been busy here, fixing bugs, adding features, and generally improving this pack. 
      * [Slack][8]: [@vutny][9] and [@chandugit][10] wrote some great updates here, adding the ability to use a specific webhook URL when posting, and cleaning up the auto-generation code and updating it in line with Slack&#8217;s recent API changes. 
          * [AWS][11]: A small but useful fix for actions which operate on tags. 
              * [Email][12]: Now you can send HTML emails, and add attachments. 
                  * [Jira][13]: Custom fields are now returned when searching issues. 
                      * [Redis][14]: This is a new pack for working with Redis. 
                          * [Kayako][15]: New pack for working with the Kayako customer ticketing system. </ul> 
                            Thanks to all those who made contributions, we deeply appreciate it.
