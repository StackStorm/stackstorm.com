<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get right to it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we feature a tutorial that published last week.  It has to do with auto-remediating your environment.  The tutorial focuses on using StackStorm to auto-remediation Cassandra; it was published at the Cassandra Summit after all &#8211; building on <strong>Netflix’s</strong> use of StackStorm for that use case.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However &#8211; and here is the kicker &#8211; keep in mind StackStorm is basically a giant lego set.  The pattern outlined in the tutorial </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">works</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Not Cassandra?  OK, have a different source of events and a different target for your actions.  MySql?  MongoDB?  Heck, even Oracle?  It can take you just a matter of minutes to adapt this tutorial to your needs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you do contribute back some remediation patterns &#8211; your name can appear in lights as a guest blogger.  Ping us on our community channel on Slack and we can help you adapt the pattern this blog highlights to your particular circumstances.  </span>

Here&#8217;s that tutorial:  <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/09/22/auto-remediating-bad-hosts-in-cassandra-cluster-with-stackstorm/" target="_blank">https://stackstorm.com/2015/09/22/auto-remediating-bad-hosts-in-cassandra-cluster-with-stackstorm/</a>

And the GIF from the tutorial.  Have at it!
