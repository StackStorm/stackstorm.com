**Palo Alto, Calif. –** <a href="http://stackstorm.com/" target="_blank">StackStorm</a>, a software company leading the third wave of operations automation, today announced it will host a joint online meetup with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-Online-Meetup/" target="_blank">OpenStack Online Meetup</a>, focused on the OpenStack IT community across the world. During the meetup, attendees will discuss automation projects within OpenStack, their maturity, possible use cases and their likely direction.

Organized by Rafael Knuth, OpenStack and Hadoop community manager, and Stephen Spector, HP cloud evangelist, the OpenStack Online Meetup aims to facilitate dialogue across the OpenStack ecosystem, as well as the greater IT community. Dmitri Zimine, co-founder and CTO of StackStorm, will join them to discuss OpenStack automation projects including Mistral, Heat, TaskFlow and Congress, and provide best practices for each. He will discuss each tool in detail and its benefits to IT and the organization as a whole.

“The OpenStack Online meetup is a great forum for users to come together and explore new tools in the ecosystem,” said Knuth. “We look forward to co-hosting this session with Dmitri to discuss the current state of IT automation and how it will evolve within the OpenStack ecosystem.”

“As enterprises adopt OpenStack, their infrastructure changes drastically, and automation tools can enable IT to easily transition to open source applications,” said Zimine. “This meetup is an opportunity to share what I have learned working with open source automation tools over the last few years. The next wave of automation is coming, and a good understanding of available tools will help IT make a successful transition.”
