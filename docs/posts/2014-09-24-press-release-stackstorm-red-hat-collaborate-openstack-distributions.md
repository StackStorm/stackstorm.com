Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform is a highly scalable Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) product that delivers an open, flexible and enterprise-ready private cloud foundation, built on OpenStack and integrated with and optimized for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. StackStorm delivers automation that safely ties together loosely coupled, heterogeneous, ever changing cloud infrastructures including private and public clouds. StackStorm’s foundation has been in OpenStack, where it is a leading contributor for Project Mistral, the OpenStack workflow-as-a-service project.

“The work done through this collaboration gives our customers the confidence that StackStorm and Red Hat OpenStack have been thoroughly tested and are validated as interoperable,” said Evan Powell, CEO, StackStorm. “As we approach broad availability of our software, building partnerships with industry leaders such as Red Hat is crucial. We look forward to working closely together with Red Hat.”

The Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure Partner Network connects both business and technical resources to third-party technology companies who are aligning with Red Hat’s <a href="http://www.redhat.com/en/insights/openstack" target="_blank">OpenStack product offerings</a>. Since the launch of the program in April 2013, hundreds of software, plug-ins, and hardware systems have been added to the list of certified and supported OpenStack commercial solutions. The partners building these solutions work closely with Red Hat to offer customers an enterprise-ready and commercial-grade OpenStack infrastructure, with complementary technologies integrated across compute, networking and storage. The Red Hat OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure Partner Network includes industry leading partners from around the world, including independent hardware vendors (IHVs), original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), system integrators (SIs), managed service providers (MSPs), and communication service providers (CSPs) who have joined the program to provide certified solutions and launch their own practices to support customer deployments.
