_**Like Chef, Puppet, and Ansible, open source StackStorm system helps automate interactions between parts of IT**_

**November 4, 2014**

<p style="color: #4e4242;">
  <a style="href="http://stackstorm.com/" target="_blank">StackStorm</a>, staffed by former members of GitHub, PuppetLabs, SwiftStack, Rackspace, and the Apache Libcloud team, has launched the first public version of its eponymous open source operations automation solution.
</p>

<p style="color: #4e4242;">
  Written in Python and <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2" target="new">available</a> under the Apache 2.0 license, StackStorm gives IT departments a way to automatically trigger or drive behaviors in one part of their infrastructure via events in another. Events ranging from troubleshooting to continuous integration can be made into scriptable processes [&#8230;]
