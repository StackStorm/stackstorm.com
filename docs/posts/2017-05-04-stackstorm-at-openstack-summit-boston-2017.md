The StackStorm team is looking forward to seeing old friends and making new ones as we gather to share best practices and learn innovative approaches to delivering applications in the cloud.

Designing, deploying, and managing OpenStack, with an ever increasing number of components, services, and tools to choose from, is a complex process. With event-driven automation, StackStorm provides an elegant solution for greater resiliency, adaptability and auto-remediation of your OpenStack deployments.

The topics above just scratch the surface of StackStorm capabilities. In fact, one of the greatest strengths of StackStorm is its community- with over 2000 integrations to date. Check out [StackStorm Exchange][2] &#8211; home to dozens of integrations with most of tools you already know and use.

Stop by to see us at the booth and let’s unleash your imagination on how you can include StackStorm in your overall OpenStack automation strategy. If you know us—you know we’re passionate about event-driven automation. And if you are not already a Stormer, you will be… once you see all the cool things StackStorm can do.

We look forward to seeing you in Boston!
