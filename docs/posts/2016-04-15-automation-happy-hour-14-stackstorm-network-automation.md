It&#8217;s time for our next Automation Happy Hour, the first one as part of Brocade.

This is a chance for us to introduce a couple of new team members and dive even deeper into the topic of network automation.



Take a listen to hear about Brocade’s roadmap for network automation via StackStorm. If you want to automate your network and integrate with other domains using devops, this session is for you. Come and see how the network can benefit from devops-style automation.
