<span style="color: #404040;">The bi-weekly &#8220;Automation Happy Hour&#8221; is StackStorm&#8217;s way of connecting directly with the community and solving automation challenges together. So far, so good!</span>

Stormers Patrick Hoolboom, Lakshmi Kannan and Manas Kelshikar led a great discussion on StackStorm and ChatOps. If you missed it or want to listen in again, please check out the complete discussion below.
