We have been doing a little tidying up around here, giving the website a small facelift. Our contributors have not rested either, with more pack updates including NetBox, PagerDuty, Atlassian Crowd and InfluxDB. Here&#8217;s the details:

## Updated Look & Feel

We&#8217;ve made a few changes to our main website at [stackstorm.com][1].

The [main page][1] has a new look, and new animations:

Features have been moved to their [own page][3], and our [Case Studies][4] are updated. Read stories from users at Target, Pearson, NL-IX and more.

And if you do spot anything that doesn&#8217;t look right, drop me a line to let me know? Please? <support@stackstorm.com>.

## New & Updated Packs

  * [PagerDuty][5]: Complete pack rewrite, with more than 50 new actions. A great piece of work from [Ian Price][6]. Pay close attention if you use this pack &#8211; actions have changed, and you will need to update your workflows.
  * [NetBox][7]: NetBox is my favorite Network &#8220;Source of Truth.&#8221; It has been developing rapidly, which can be hard to keep up with. Now, thanks to [John Anderson][8], we can keep up with it. He has written code to auto-generate actions based upon the NetBox OpenAPI spec.Thanks!
  * [InfluxDB][9]: Another favorite tool of mine &#8211; we now have actions for querying & writing to the [InfluxDB][10] timeseries DB.
  * [Atlassian Crowd][11]: A new pack for working with Atlassian&#8217;s [identity management system][12].

As always, thanks to all contributors.
