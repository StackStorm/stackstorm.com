We’re excited to let you know that StackStorm has joined Brocade!

As you probably know, Brocade (NASDAQ: [BRCD][1]) is a leader in networking, with solutions spanning software networking, network fabrics, switching, routing, storage area networking and more. StackStorm is joining Brocade to help accelerate the company’s efforts to bring DevOps style scalable open source automation to Brocade’s networking solutions. Under Brocade, the StackStorm technology will be extended to networking and new integrations will be developed for automation across IT domains such as storage, compute, and security.

One reason we’re excited about the acquisition is that we’re confident the StackStorm community will continue to flourish and you will see an even larger StackStorm team collaborating with the community. The last few months have seen integrations with a variety of security systems, more monitoring, Kubernetes and much more; we are confident we’re just getting started and that the rest of 2016 will see a continued acceleration of StackStorm usage and community contributions and feedback.

We hope you’re as excited as we are about combining the StackStorm team and technology with the world-class engineering, innovation, and resources of Brocade. We look forward to continuing to work with you and growing this vibrant community!

On a personal note, let us just say thank you for supporting StackStorm. What began as a dream just a couple of years ago is now being embraced and carried forward on a much bigger stage and it could never have happened without your support and feedback. I hope you feel some much deserved pride of ownership in our success.

Yours in ever more powerful automation,

Evan, Dmitri and the entire StackStorm team.
