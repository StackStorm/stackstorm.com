  <em>StackStorm at Monitorama 2017 </em>
</p>

StackStorm is a silver sponsor of Monitorama 2017, and we- along with our great panel from LinkedIn, Sensu, and VictorOps- are looking forward to sharing with you key insights from the show&#8211;and to help you build a map for leveraging auto-remediation to optimize your operations.

Wondering how to start your automation journey and which tasks you should automate first? Or have you started to automate, and are wondering how to take your automation to the next level?  
<!--more-->

  
Our panel will share how auto-remediation- creating automated workflows based on input from your monitoring systems- is a proven way to help minimize alert &#8220;noise&#8221;, minimize operations engineer burn-out, and significantly increase overall system health.

Join us for a great interactive discussion, collaborate with your peers, and generate ideas on how to take the next step in your automation journey.
