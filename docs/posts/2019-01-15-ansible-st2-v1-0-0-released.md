We&#8217;re very excited to announce that Ansible roles to deploy StackStorm have been promoted to major version `1.0.0`!

Surprisingly, `1.0.0` is not too much about announcing role stability, &#8211; the repository <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="stackstorm/ansible-st2 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2" target="_blank">stackstorm/ansible-st2</a> was actively maintained for more than `3` years and there is no reason to say that Ansible deployment is not stable yet. Because it already had more than `30` releases, this time there were no versions left for a major change and so finally `v1.0.0` was shipped. A great chance to celebrate this big milestone! ðŸŽ‰

With over `55+` Github stars, `150+` pull requests and `700+` commits from `25` contributors we want to thank our community for their support: reporting bugs, generating ideas as well as submitting pull requests. It wouldn&#8217;t be possible without you, our users! With over `100K` Ansible Galaxy downloads, `ansible-st2` became one of the most popular and discussed production-ready StackStorm deployments.

What&#8217;s changed? In recent releases there was a lot of ongoing maintenance related to StackStorm version to version differences: nodejs `6` -> `8` version update for `st2chatops` role, support for new st2 services like `st2workflowengine` , `st2timersengine`, `st2scheduler`, fixes, improvements and more. 

There are some more user-facing changes in v1.0.0: minimum required Ansible version was bumped to `v2.5` that led to some unavoidable syntax changes, &#8211; as you may know Ansible `v2.4` reached end of its life and officially unsupported. Besides that, the `BWC` sub-role which installs and configures StackStorm Enterprise offering was renamed to `EWC`, &#8211; don&#8217;t forget to update role references in your plays if you&#8217;re using Enterprise. If not, &#8211; it&#8217;s time to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://stackstorm.com/features/" target="_blank">Try StackStorm Enterprise with a free 90-day trial</a>.
