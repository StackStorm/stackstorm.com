  PALO ALTO, Calif.&#8211;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#8211;
</p>

<p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1410450401034_1421" style="color: #000000;">
  <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fstackstorm.com%2F&esheet=50939513&newsitemid=20140910005201&lan=en-US&anchor=StackStorm&index=1&md5=eb3b75486896c3562cb66d1cd0af371e" rel="nofollow" data-rapid_p="1">StackStorm</a>, a software company leading the third wave of operations automation, today revealed a strategic partnership to integrate StackStorm products with software and services from Mirantis, the largest OpenStack systems integrator. StackStorm has also increased its commitment to the OpenStack community, becoming an official sponsor of the OpenStack Foundation.
</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">
  “Partners like StackStorm help Mirantis fulfill its mission to be the leading pure play OpenStack company by delivering industry leading capabilities that add value to underlying OpenStack,” said Boris Renski, co-founder, Mirantis. “We are delighted that StackStorm is a Mirantis Technology Partner and that we will be able to extend our engineering collaboration to joint marketing, sales and support.”

<p style="color: #000000;">
  As part of the partnership with Mirantis, StackStorm will be compatible with this leading OpenStack distribution. StackStorm is a leading contributor for Project Mistral, the OpenStack workflow as a service project.
</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">
  “OpenStack is rapidly becoming the software of choice for organizations looking to deploy private clouds,” said Jonathan Bryce, executive director, OpenStack Foundation. “StackStorm has made significant contributions to OpenStack through Project Mistral, which delivers workflow as a service. We welcome StackStorm to the OpenStack community and thank them for their ongoing and increased support.”
</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">
  StackStorm is building a set of industry partnerships as it approaches broad availability of its operations automation software later this year. Now in private beta, StackStorm software helps private and public cloud users to more easily author, manage, share and extend operations automation so that mainstream users can achieve the 10-100x productivity boosts that highly automated operators such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others currently enjoy.
</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">
  “Mirantis is one of the leading OpenStack distributions in the industry today, and we intend to heavily invest in our partnerships so that users can leverage StackStorm alongside Mirantis software and services,” said Evan Powell, CEO, StackStorm. “OpenStack is playing an increasingly important role in the industry, and enables users to achieve the power and flexibility of the cloud without the rigidity and cost of proprietary cloud services and private cloud platforms. While our software supports more than OpenStack, we depend heavily on the community and are happy to be increasing our support.”
