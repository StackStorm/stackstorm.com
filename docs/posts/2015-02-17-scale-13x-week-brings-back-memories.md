  So <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x" target="_blank">SCALEÂ 13x</a> is this week. I&#8217;m looking forward to it for a bunch of reasons.
</p>

<p style="color: #4d4f51;">
  First and foremost, I&#8217;m looking forward to fellow Stormer James Fryman holding forth on <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x/presentations/devops-day-2-people-and-process" target="_blank">lessons learned</a> from his time at GitHub, StackStorm, Puppet and elsewhere this Friday at 1:00 pm. James is speaking around the world on this and related topics (hello ChatOps!) and will be great.
</p>

  Also, we at StackStorm gave our first public talk as a company last year when my co-founder Dmitri Zimine talked about OpenStack and DevOps from a VMware administrator&#8217;s perspective. He&#8217;s since been pinged by a variety of folks who wanted him to deliver some flavor of that talk. As he&#8217;s helped build vSphere &#8211; specifically running vSphere client for years before founding StackStorm &#8211; and now as our CTO at StackStorm which is being rapidly adopted in larger DevOps shops for event driven automation &#8211; he&#8217;s a great speaker on the subject.

  And farther back Nexenta often exhibited at SCALE 13x including with friends from PogoLinux and elsewhere. So it&#8217;ll be good to reconnect with those friends.
</p>

<p style="color: #4d4f51;">
  Maybe most importantly, last year&#8217;s content in the &#8220;devops track&#8221; was good and I&#8217;m looking forward to helping sponsor that track this year.
</p>

<p style="color: #4d4f51;">
  I guess my final point about SCALE would be that it has a great feel to it. Even over lunch &#8211; I remember eating on the roof last year a box lunch with guys from Ticketmaster who were extremely knowledgeable about running at scale and also really humble &#8211; you connect with good people without a lot of BS.
</p>

<p style="color: #4d4f51;">
  If you are at SCALE this year, please do stop by booth 76 where we will be demo&#8217;ing, listening, learning, debating and&#8230; giving out free stickers! Stickers!
</p>

<p style="color: #4d4f51;">
  And don&#8217;t miss James&#8217; talk at 1pm on Friday.
</p>

<p style="color: #4d4f51;">
  **For those of you who won&#8217;t be attending in person, the SCALE sessions will be live-streamed on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/socallinuxexpo" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.
