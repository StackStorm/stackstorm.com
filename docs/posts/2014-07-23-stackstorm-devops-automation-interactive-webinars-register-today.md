Two interactive feedback sessions will be held in which Evan Powell, CEO of StackStorm, will share his vision for self-driving data centers and introduce the audience to StackStorm. Patrick Hoolboom, engineer at StackStorm, who most recently led the DevOps effort at Cloudmark, will join Evan to tell StackStorm’s story.

In the meeting, we’ll share some of what we’ve learned including:

* Common DevOps automation patterns – lessons drawn from over 125 interviews  
* Infrastructure as code – fundamentals of DevOps architecture  
* StackStorm’s software – an introduction  
* Self-driving data centers – the future

We hope you can join us for one of the two sessions!
