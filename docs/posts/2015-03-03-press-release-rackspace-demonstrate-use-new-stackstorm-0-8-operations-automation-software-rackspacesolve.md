**PALO ALTO, Calif. – March 3, 2015 –** StackStorm, a provider of event-driven automation software, today announced that Rackspace will demonstrate its use of the newly launched StackStorm 0.8 to automate autoscaling and continuous integration (CI) and delivery (CD) deployments at <a href="http://solve.rackspace.com/sanfrancisco.html" target="_blank">Rackspace::Solve</a> on March 4 in San Francisco, Calif.  StackStorm 0.8, which has been released today, includes a significant number of platform improvements, new integrations, and feature requests including the first release of an intuitive and 100 percent open source graphical user interface.

“Rackspace’s use and advocacy of StackStorm validates our mission to provide users with event-driven automation software that integrates well into their environments so that the rest of us can achieve the massive boosts in agility enjoyed by the web scale operators,” said Evan Powell, co-founder and CEO of StackStorm. “For example, Rackspace is using StackStorm 0.8 to deliver a unique approach to autoscaling that embraces the heterogeneity of enterprise environments.”

Enhancements of StackStorm 0.8 include:

<!--more-->

  * StackStorm Web UI – The StackStorm web user interface makes it easier to manage, tie together and extend automated environments;
  * Rules management enhancements – StackStorm includes a simple and yet powerful open source rules engine so that automations can respond to events in intelligent ways. This rules engine has been enhanced through the addition of visual authoring via the Web UI as well as through improved troubleshooting of rules execution;
  * Workflows – StackStorm allows users to combine simple actions – everything from AWS and OpenStack and vSphere and Docker actions to packaging and testing and custom scripted actions – into powerful workflows. To enable this Lego-like assembly of trusted, scalable automation, StackStorm leverages two flavors of workflow, each of which were enhanced in StackStorm 0.8, addressing common user requests and improving manageability from the StackStorm CLI and the new Web UI;
  * History – As StackStorm is used it accumulates integrations and rules and automations, thereby becoming more and more useful since these Lego bricks are reused and tied into ever more valuable automations over time. History is crucial to understand which of these components are performing well and under what conditions. History has been enhanced in several ways, including being made available via the Web UI;
  * Integration management – StackStorm now has several hundred more integrations available via the StackStorm forge than were available when StackStorm was initially open sourced in November 2014. StackStorm 0.8 makes it easier to control the placement of community and user generated integrations and automations in user directories and source code management systems.

The Rackspace demonstration, which will feature how StackStorm can integrate and automate heterogeneous environments, will take place on March 4 at 2:25 p.m. in San Francisco, Calif. Rackspace will highlight how StackStorm for autoscaling is cloud neutral, human-centric, and ChatOps-oriented, while enabling users to embrace their legacy. StackStorm will also be exhibiting in the Solutions Pavilion.
