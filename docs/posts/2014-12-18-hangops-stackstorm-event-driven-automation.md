StackStorm was recently invited to speak on [<a href="http://www.hangops.com" target="_blank">HangOps</a>] to discuss a growing trend in IT Operations &#8211; event driven automation. I spoke with Brandon Burton and other community members about the basic concepts of event driven automation and how StackStorm enables companies of all sizes start or continue their journey implementing DevOps practices. Topics discussed in this podcast include: Intersecting Event Driven Infrastructure with ChatOps, Practical Use-cases for StackStorm, and future growth of the platform and community at large.
