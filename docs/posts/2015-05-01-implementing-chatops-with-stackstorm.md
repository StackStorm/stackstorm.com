ChatOps is the methodology of bringing operations work that you are already doing into the context of the conversation you are currently having. Ultimately, leveraging ChatOps leads to increased transparency and democratized IT delivery. To achieve this, SMEs should codify their knowledge using a system such as StackStorm to help form that information so that it is consumable by everyone.

Check out myÂ [talk][1] discussing not only the philosophy behind and history of ChatOps, but also best practices for implementing and maintaining ChatOps in your environment.

With our v0.9 release, we have added a feature to enable ChatOps. ChatOps via StackStorm is ready for trial and we would really appreciate some feedback. Please follow the [instructions][2] to set up ChatOps using StackStorm.
