&lt;p>The agility at which the business can respond to real-life situations is proportional to the level of digitization that has been implemented in the business. For a business to nimble and agile, it is imperative that all the processes be delivered as a digital service that can be provisioned, monitored and remediated by an automation logic at the core of the business. The automation logic should follow the &lt;a href="https://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/glossary/m/mape_loop.html">Monitor, Assess, Plan and Execute (MAPE) loop&lt;/a> methodology to provide a complete closed-loop automation system for the digital business.
