<p>ChatOps — a concept where a chat bot acts as a control plane for your operations — has always been a core part of StackStorm. It adds context to your actions, automates routine tasks nobody likes, helps team members communicate better and learn from each other, and sometimes it’s just plain fun. If you’re new to this, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37LmuHToYjQ">DevOps Next Steps talk</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jfryman">James Fryman</a>, and if you’ve been writing Eggdrop scripts in IRC since you were five but never used it in your daily operations, you might also get inspired from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw">ChatOps at GitHub talk</a> by Jesse Newland.</p>
<p>Today, we’re all excited to introduce — as a part of our <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v1.2.0">1.2.0 release</a> — a completely revamped ChatOps feature list. If you’re already using our Hubot integration to execute StackStorm actions from chat, stop doing whatever it is you’re doing and update! If not, it’s a good time to get started: ChatOps is the way of the future, now more than ever.</p>

<p>Time and time again, we hear of companies achieving rapid acceleration with DevOps. Companies are touting success with the metric of deploys/day, sharing new baselines of 10, 50 or even 100 deploys/day. In more mature organizations the likes of LinkedIn, Netflix, Etsy, Facebook and others, this number is a startling 1,000+ number. But, what does this even mean?</p>
<p>Unpacking this number is often one IT leaders stumble on, and is the greatest source of pushback when talking about rapid acceleration. How stable is the software being delivered? How many of these deployments are successful? What constitutes a deployment?</p>
<p>These questions and more often end up creating analysis paralysis, and nothing changes. In fact, the most common response starts with, “There is no way we could implement something like that at my company because…” We know this to be false. Companies who have traditionally delivered in a waterfall fashion with a single, bloated deploy per month or quarter are successfully transitioning to rapid deployment posting similar baseline numbers as other teams.</p>
<p>How then can you be successful in beginning software delivery? There is no single silver bullet or magic wand, but there is a fairly prescriptive methodology for achieving our goal of rapid delivery. Let’s dive in and take a look on how to get started.</p>

<h6 id="introduction">Introduction</h6>
<p>The StackStorm community repo has a rich integration pack for EC2 and Route53 action that you can find inside the <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. These actions are incredibly useful but they are just the building blocks. The real power of using StackStorm actions comes when they are stitched together into workflows. I’ve taken the two basic workflows we use for EC2 instance lifecycle management and genericized them, then added them to the AWS integration pack. I’m going to go over how these can be used to greatly simplify creation and termination of instances.</p>
<h6 id="why">Why?</h6>
<p>At StackStorm we needed a way to rapidly provision VMs that had all of our bootstrapping done…and it had to be easy to do from the command line or StackStorm UI. This version of the workflow has been simplified to remove some of our internal bootstrapping steps but still reduces the entire process of instance creation, DNS registration, and basic bootstrapping to a single command.</p>

Last month, we attended DevOpsDays Silicon Valley and had a great time meeting other people in the industry while learning about different DevOps tools and best practices. It was the fifth anniversary of the event and we were honored to be a part of the sold out show! I gave an Ignite Talk on the “10 Reasons Why DevOps is the Greatest Shift in the IT Industry.

<p>As an entrepreneur betting heavily – in time, money, and relationships – on OpenStack, I’m biased towards its success and more than a little interested in how it is growing up. I have long believed in open infrastructure and remain convinced that OpenStack is the best chance we all have for a future of greater innovation, quality, capability, and, yes, affordability for cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>I first looked at OpenStack a number of years ago when growing Nexenta and creating a market we then called the OpenStorage market, and recently took some time to look at the entire project and how far it’s come, as well as some emerging challenges.</p>
