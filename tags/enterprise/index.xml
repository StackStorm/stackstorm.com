&lt;p>More groups are progressing from just talking about Event-Driven Automation to actually doing it in practice. StackStorm helps make this easy. When organizations start offloading business-critical tasks and automating for real it becomes essential to ensure that the Automation engine itself is not a single point of failure when it is responsible for recovering a fleet of servers, managing datacenters, and automating remediations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>StackStorm was designed to be cloud-native, API-driven, easily deployed, microservice-oriented, resilient and can be scaled out horizontally to fulfill High Availability and/or High Load demands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously we only documented best practices describing how to distribute StackStorm in HA mode (&lt;a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html">docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html&lt;/a>), giving a high level overview regarding StackStorm design and how to ensure its redundancy. Based on those recommendations, some companies were spending weeks to months to codify a complex st2 HA infrastructure and iterate over their deployments until finding that “silver bullet” stability/production state.&lt;/p>
