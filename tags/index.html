        Puppet Module to Install StackStorm – Announcing Release Candidate

<em>By <a href="https://github.com/nmaludy">Nick Maludy</a> of <a href="http://www.encore.tech">Encore Technologies</a></em></p>
<p>So far StackStorm has multiple installation methods: deb/rpm packages, <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/index.html#ref-one-line-install"><code>curl|bash</code></a> installer used for simple deployments, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2-docker">Docker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/chef-stackstorm">Chef</a>.</p>
<p>Now it’s Puppet time!</p>
<p>Starting in July of 2017 a major effort has been underway to modernize the Puppet module to install/deploy StackStorm. In August of 2017 <code>v1.0.0-beta</code> was released with completely re-worked internals to support the new StackStorm <code>deb/rpm</code> package installation method and fix a large number of bugs. Since the beta we’ve continued development of new features like supporting all 4 StackStorm OSes, Puppet 4 and 5 compatibility, ChatOps installation and configuration, modernized pack management, full integration testing in Docker containers along with a slew of Puppet best practices improvements.</p>
<p>Today we’re proud to announce the Release Candidate version <code>v1.0.0-rc</code> of the <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2"><code>stackstorm-st2</code></a> Puppet module which is available on Forge.<br>
<a href="https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2"><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2<br>
</a><br>
Our plan is to release <code>v1.0.0</code> stable in the coming weeks, but in order to do this we need your help. We ask everyone who is interested in Puppet-based deployment to give the module a try and provide your feedback!</p>
<p>Keep reading to find out more details about what’s changed and where the project is heading.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-octopusdeploy">What is OctopusDeploy?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.octopusdeploy.com">Octopus Deploy</a> is an automated deployment tool for .NET and Windows environments. It has gained significant popularity amongst the .NET development community for it’s ease of use and integration into the Microsoft development ecosystem. OctopusDeploy enables users to automate deployment of applications, packages and tools to Windows environments.</p>
<h2 id="why-integrate-octopusdeploy-into-stackstorm">Why integrate OctopusDeploy into StackStorm?</h2>
<p>Octopus Deploy provides a rich system for Windows application deployments, but this is typically part of a wider DevOps process. Unlike StackStorm, it does not support closed-loop monitoring, remediation or infrastructure configuration and building, it does not integrate into configuration management tools (nor claim to). If you want to integrate OctopusDeploy from another tool, as part of a DevOps or environment tool you could</p>

<p>Ready to automatically provision and maintain StackStorm nodes in production? Then the <code>stackstorm-st2</code> Puppet module is for you! We’re proud to announce the <code>v1.0.0</code> stable release of <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2</a>, the StackStorm Puppet module.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/puppet-st2"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Puppet is an excellent tool that allows the user to declare the desired state of their system in code. Once defined, hand over the reins to Puppet and watch as it transforms your nodes into what you’ve declared. We wanted to bring the power of declarative state to StackStorm deployments, and <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">puppet-st2</a> is that solution.</p>

<p>Find StackStorm v1.0.0 on Puppet Forge, – <a href="https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2">https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2</a></p>

<p>A great deal of work has gone into the <code>v1.0.0</code> release to ensure that <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/install/puppet.html">st2 Puppet Module</a> is ready to provision and manage StackStorm nodes in production environments. See January, 2018 <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2018/01/05/announcing-puppet-module-1-0-0-rc/">Puppet Module to Install StackStorm – Announcing Release Candidate</a>. Over the past year we’ve iterated through several pre-releases, release-candidate versions, fixed a lot of bugs, reworked the entire module structure and can now declare it stable and production ready.</p>

<p>ChatOps brings the context of work you are already doing into the conversations you are already having. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jfryman<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>ChatOps is still a fresh and uncommon thing in the DevOps world, where work is brought into a shared chat room. You can run commands directly from chat and everyone in the chatroom can see the history of work being done, do the same, interact with each other and even learn. The information and process is owned by the entire team which brings a lot of benefits.</p>

<p>We’re always happy when the number of integrations to StackStorm increases, creating bridges between more DevOps tools and extending possible use cases.  Our IFTTT for Ops approach – or Event Driven Automation – becomes more valuable the more ways to control and listen to your environment come pre-integrated, “batteries included.”</p>

<p>This tutorial will show you how to leverage the power of the StackStorm API to expose your fantastic new workflows built using the Flow (available to Enterprise Edition uses) by <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/02/tutorial-of-the-week-cassandra-auto-remediation/">following one of the blogs</a>.</p>
<p>In our fictional scenario, we have built 2 complex workflows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Engage Tractor Beam, this workflow deploys some virtual machines to cloud, uses Hubot to notify the staff and then Puppet to drive the tractor beam.</li>
<li>Open/Close loading bay doors, this workflow takes the desired state of the doors to drive another workflow.</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to provide our technical operations team with a really simple UI where they can just click these buttons and we hide the magic behind the scenes.</p>
<h2 id="starting-off">Starting off</h2>
<p>First off, this is a tutorial for ASP.NET 4.5, MVC 5 and WebAPI 2.0, the latest Microsoft Web Development toolkit.</p>
<p>If you want to use another stack, you can follow the patterns here to repeat in another language.</p>
<p>Opening up Visual Studio (here I am using 2013, 2015 would also work), select the ASP.NET Web Application template</p>

<p>Recently we explained how to use <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/10/21/auto-remediation-stackstorm-splunk/"><strong>Syslog with Splunk &amp; StackStorm</strong></a> to auto-remediate a link going down on a switch. Splunk is a widely used log management tool but there’s also a popular open source alternative – <a href="https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack"><strong>Elastic Stack</strong></a> (formerly the ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana). So if you’re using the Elastic Stack, and are looking to automate event remediation in your environment, you’re at the right place! In this post, we’re taking the same <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/10/21/auto-remediation-stackstorm-splunk/">use case as before</a> and talking about how to set up the Elastic stack to collect syslog data and trigger event-based network remediation workflows using <strong>StackStorm</strong>.</p>

<p>Lights flashing at the StackStorm-Brocade booth made event-driven automation feel real with the IoT demo entertaining enterprise and DevOps crowds alike. Mirantis’ talk about auto-healing Symantec OpenStack cloud with StackStorm sparkled hallway conversations about auto-remediation. Our guerrilla hacking challenge was success, unveiled that the best hackers are all co-located…(guess where, anyone?)</p>

<p>A host is running out of disk space. What follows is a routine pager panic and rush in cleaning things up, at best. At worst, downtime. It is silly, but it happens much more than most of us care to admit.</p>
<p>This, and many other annoying events like this can, and shall be auto-remediated. The “classic” pattern of wiring monitoring to and paging is simply not good enough, and know it when you’re paged at 3am to clean the disk on production server.</p>
<p>And to those of you who hard-wire their remediation scripts into Nagios/Sensu event handlers, Splunk alert scripts and NewRelic web hooks: it is plain wrong there’s a better way.</p>
<p>In this blog, we show how StackStorm auto-remediation platform helps you hand out-of-disk case, with step-by-step walk-through and a working automation sample to kick-start your auto-remediation.</p>

Learn how we achieved this, watch the <em>2 min video</em> to see it in action. Read the blog for details. Grab our code recipe and adjust it to your liking and use to auto-scale your Swarm on AWS.</p>

<p>We had a great afternoon with the <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd12">NFD</a> team as we walked them through our vision, design principles and demos of the Brocade Workflow Composer. We had productive discussions and got good, candid feedback. Caffeine and sugar kept everyone’s critical abilities to the max. There’s 4 separate video sessions…here’s what happened:</p>

<p>As an entrepreneur betting heavily – in time, money, and relationships – on OpenStack, I’m biased towards its success and more than a little interested in how it is growing up. I have long believed in open infrastructure and remain convinced that OpenStack is the best chance we all have for a future of greater innovation, quality, capability, and, yes, affordability for cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>I first looked at OpenStack a number of years ago when growing Nexenta and creating a market we then called the OpenStorage market, and recently took some time to look at the entire project and how far it’s come, as well as some emerging challenges.</p>

<p>We love our users. We love them even when they report bugs. We love them <strong>because</strong> they report bugs. But we <strong>really, really</strong> love our users when they report bugs, along with complete configurations, how to reproduce the bug, and logs. Recently <a href="https://github.com/bri365">Brian Martin</a> did just this, helping us resolve a tricky deadlock bug. Thank you Brian!</p>
<h2 id="tracking-down-deadlocks">Tracking down Deadlocks</h2>
<p>When you’re investigating a bug report, the first thing you want to do is to try to reproduce it. This helps you see what’s going on, and it gives you a clear test case to see if you’ve resolved it. Deadlocks &amp; race conditions can be horrible bugs to work with, as they are often difficult to reproduce. They might depend upon your hardware resources, or what other jobs are running at the same time. Even reproducing it on the exact same setup is tough.</p>

The 2020 ChatOps User Survey is here! This is your chance to submit your feedback on using ChatOps with StackStorm – what we get right, what we get wrong, and what we need to focus on.
We will use this feedback to chart the development roadmap for ChatOps, whether that means leaving st2chatops as-is, or focusing on supporting more chat providers, deeper feature support for specific providers, improving ChatOps integration with the rest of StackStorm (RBAC for ChatOps!

<p>ChatOps has been a key part of StackStorm from the outset. Even before 1.0, our first public release, you could execute any action or workflow from your chat window and get a bunch of text in response. Like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aJCOKC9.png" alt=""><br>
<em>StackStorm 1.0, September 2015</em></p>
<p>Last September (even less than a year ago, to think about it) ChatOps as a defined collaboration model was still relatively new, and the ability to execute a StackStorm action or workflow from chat was enough to excite early adopters. You could make basic workflows and routine actions work, and it made your job a little easier while keeping your teammates in the loop. However, when you wanted to read and share the output, a dumped Python object as a response wasn’t ideal.</p>

<p>These days ChatOps has become all the rage. In this blog I’ll talk a little bit about how we came to be here – in a leading position when it comes to ChatOps adoption for operations. And I’ll point you to some resources from users and our own engineers to learn more.</p>
<p>The history lesson will be brief, I promise.</p>
<p>We started StackStorm after observing that existing solutions in the devops universe were generally point solutions, often evolved from scripts and other projects that DevOps engineers wrote to make their own lives easier. And that’s a great way to build a solution that appeals at least to those types of users for those specific use cases.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What we saw was that while there were leaders within certain segments amongst those tools, there was no clearly adopted pattern for the wiring that tied all these tools together. Moreover, with our backgrounds in enterprises we knew that wiring together extremely heterogeneous environments is always a challenge. The enterprise is more a brownfield than a greenfield.</p>
<p>A quick shout out to teams at Facebook and at WebEx Spark and all those other early interviewees that taught us so much about event driven automation. And if you want to join a non commercial Bay Area meet-up about the subject and hear speakers from organizations like Facebook and LinkedIn and Netflix, please join here:<br>

<p>In the post <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm QuickTip: ChatOps your pack dev workflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> James Fryman gave a ChatOPS alias recipe to reduce the friction for deploying packs and then in the <em>Random Thoughts</em> section asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This action is tied directly to the <code>packs.install</code>. What about a workflow? Seems like that would be a better way to structure this.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonated with me as I had already started working on an internal pack that did just that, as I thought attempting to deploy a pack via an alias (and action) contained within the same pack would be madness (or just lead to interesting race conditions). In the last week, our <em>Pull Request</em> has been merged, documentation has been included in st2docs (<a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/chatops/pack_deploy.html">link</a>) for a workflow that fulfils the above random thought and should be released with 1.4.</p>
<p>So introducing <code>packs.deploy</code>, an action written in Mistral to handle the mapping of names for Git repositories to the information required to carry out the <code>packs.install</code> action.</p>

<p>Recently I’ve been playing around Stackstorm – a platform for integration and automation of day-to-day tasks, monitoring events, existing scripts and deployment tools.</p>
<p>I am going to explain how easy it is to wrap your daily tasks into Stackstorm actions and workflows and how to provide a simple way of execution for complex tasks.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking for a while and initially I was going to bring everything up in one blog post. But later, it didn’t seem like a good idea. That being said, I’d rather break it into multiple posts, no matter how many there would be. Anyway, it seems to me that it’d be more practical and easier to read and understand.</p>
<h2 id="nagios">Nagios</h2>
<p>Let’s start with integrating Nagios alerts into Stackstorm. Assuming that you already have Stackstorm version 1.2.0+ installed, configured and running, as well as there’s Nagios running somewhere else that is capable of processing alerts and handling events. If not, please, proceed to &lt;www.stackstorm.com&gt; and &lt;www.nagios.org&gt; (installation and initial configuration of these two tools is beyond the scope of this post). Both tools are open source and free to use and have extensive documentation on installation and basic configuration.</p>
<p>First of all, I was happy to find an existing Nagios integration pack <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-nagios">on StackStorm community repo</a>, but my joy ended really quickly as I found it not working. Secondly, <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/05/auto-remediation-out-of-disk-space/">this StackStorm tutorial</a> helped me to get started.</p>

<p>ChatOps — a concept where a chat bot acts as a control plane for your operations — has always been a core part of StackStorm. It adds context to your actions, automates routine tasks nobody likes, helps team members communicate better and learn from each other, and sometimes it’s just plain fun. If you’re new to this, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37LmuHToYjQ">DevOps Next Steps talk</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jfryman">James Fryman</a>, and if you’ve been writing Eggdrop scripts in IRC since you were five but never used it in your daily operations, you might also get inspired from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw">ChatOps at GitHub talk</a> by Jesse Newland.</p>
<p>Today, we’re all excited to introduce — as a part of our <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v1.2.0">1.2.0 release</a> — a completely revamped ChatOps feature list. If you’re already using our Hubot integration to execute StackStorm actions from chat, stop doing whatever it is you’re doing and update! If not, it’s a good time to get started: ChatOps is the way of the future, now more than ever.</p>

<p>ChatOps brings the context of work you are already doing into the conversations you are already having. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jfryman<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>ChatOps is still a fresh and uncommon thing in the DevOps world, where work is brought into a shared chat room. You can run commands directly from chat and everyone in the chatroom can see the history of work being done, do the same, interact with each other and even learn. The information and process is owned by the entire team which brings a lot of benefits.</p>

<p>I’ve done a couple articles about getting StackStorm set up, an introductory video, and put a fair amount of effort towards minimizing the barrier to entry for new users.  Overall, I think StackStorm was successful in providing a quick and easy way to get our system up and running but users need more than that.  Users need to see how StackStorm can help solve their specific pain points.  We needed a way to illustrate that we can provide an easy to use solution without the steep learning curve of throwing out your existing tools.  Over a series of a few blog posts we are going to go over some of the ways that we have leveraged the StackStorm platform internally and how these solutions could map to your environment.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we cover CI part of CICD with Docker as an example. At a high level, this blog post will demonstrate how to create a docker image and push it to a registry on every commit to a github repo. You have probably read our own James Fryman’s excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on continuous delivery with StackStorm in a more traditional environment. If not, I highly recommend reading it. Also, this recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from docker is a great introduction to using docker in continuous delivery. Before diving into the details, below is some motivation for switching to container based immutable infrastructure.</p>

<p>As Michael Dehaan of Ansible fame notes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->immutable infrastructure is the way of the future<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Containers (especially, Docker) facilitate this by offering users a way to define their infrastructure through simple files (Dockerfile, for example). The role of orchestration tools changes when dealing with immutable infrastructure. A relevant quote from Michael Dehaan’s blog:</p>

<p>I’m “pretty excited” to share some news, we’ve just finished integrating Cisco Spark into StackStorm, via our automation-bot, Hubot.<br>
This means you can get all of the power of StackStorm chatops from within Cisco Spark rooms and collaboration experiences.</p>

<p>Cisco Spark delivers cloud-based business communications that enables customers to message, meet and call anyone, whether it be on their mobile device, desktop or meeting room end-points.</p>

<p>StackStorm is an event-driven automation platform that ties together every component of your environment. It’s commonly used for auto-remediation—including response to security events—and other cases such as complex deployments.</p>

<p>Ready to automatically provision and maintain StackStorm nodes in production? Then the <code>stackstorm-st2</code> Puppet module is for you! We’re proud to announce the <code>v1.0.0</code> stable release of <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2</a>, the StackStorm Puppet module.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/puppet-st2"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Puppet is an excellent tool that allows the user to declare the desired state of their system in code. Once defined, hand over the reins to Puppet and watch as it transforms your nodes into what you’ve declared. We wanted to bring the power of declarative state to StackStorm deployments, and <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">puppet-st2</a> is that solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find StackStorm v1.0.0 on Puppet Forge, – <a href="https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2">https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A great deal of work has gone into the <code>v1.0.0</code> release to ensure that <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/install/puppet.html">st2 Puppet Module</a> is ready to provision and manage StackStorm nodes in production environments. See January, 2018 <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2018/01/05/announcing-puppet-module-1-0-0-rc/">Puppet Module to Install StackStorm – Announcing Release Candidate</a>. Over the past year we’ve iterated through several pre-releases, release-candidate versions, fixed a lot of bugs, reworked the entire module structure and can now declare it stable and production ready.</p>

<p>No packs update over Christmas because we were taking a break – so here’s a double helping of updates to packs on the <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org">StackStorm Exchange</a>. We have new packs for Palo Alto Networks, CloudShark, updates to the OpenStack, NetBox, Device42 packs, and a bunch of bugfixes, including Consul, ServiceNow, Cisco Spark and more.

      <p>Run <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange</a> actions as AWS Lambda functions. Serverless and Stormless. 100% Open Source.</p>
<p><em>December 14, 2017</em><br>
<em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/dzimine">Dmitri Zimine</a></em></p>
<p><a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange</a> is an open source catalog of reusable actions. Integrations with everything ranging from common-man DevOps tools, suit and tie services like ServiceNow and Remedy to cool kids like Slack or Twilio, to more exotic systems like HUE Lights and Tesla cars. At the time of writing, there are 6500+ actions spread across 130 integration packs. It is Open Source, with a great community of maintainers. Something that makes StackStorm a great wiring tool to build automations integrating a wide breadth of domains.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But if you’ve taken a red pill and gone wholesale on AWS running serverless, deploying <a href="https://stackstorm.com/">StackStorm</a> may be not an option. Yet the catalog of reusable functions to integrate with commonly used services is an appealing idea. C’mon there should be 1000 Slack lambdas and 10,000 Twilio lambdas out there already, it doesn’t feel creative to write 10,001? Jealous to Azure with their <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/apis-list#popular-connectors">great library of reusable connectors</a>? Why can’t YOU grab something ready-to-use?</p>
<p>Now you can! Run StackStorm Exchange actions as lambda functions. Without StackStorm. <strong>Serverless and Stormless.</strong></p>

<p>I’m sure you’ve heard us talk about our <a href="http://stackstorm.com/community-signup">Slack channel</a>. It’s a great place for StackStorm users to get together, share ideas, and solve problems. But did you know that our Stormers are in this channel, and do their best to help support the community?</p>
<p>Our engineers hang out here from 9:00 -&gt; 17:00 PST, and often later. They’re happy to answer whatever questions you have. Just in the last few days, we’ve had questions about installation, ChatOps setup, writing sensors, purging history, creating actions, etc. Because the core engineers are involved in those discussions, not only can they help fix problems, they can also explain the design thinking.</p>

<p>The last couple of months, since the <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/03/29/stackstorm-joining-brocade/">Brocade acquisition</a>, have been pretty busy for us here at StackStorm. We have been getting to know our new friends at Brocade, learning the typical networking use-cases and figuring out how we can use StackStorm to automate them and bring all the DevOps and data-center automation goodness to the networking space, while keeping StackStorm a generic DevOps automation platform.</p>
<p>As always, we have continued to support our users and the community. We also haven’t been slacking with the StackStorm feature development and improvements. We have worked hard to bring you two new releases in the last 2 months – <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/04/20/stackstorm-v1-4/">StackStorm v1.4</a> and <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">StackStorm v1.5</a>.</p>
<p>StackStorm v1.5 which has been released just recently includes many new features and improvements so if you haven’t already, I would encourage you to go <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Today I will talk about the one of the major new features in StackStorm v1.5 which has been <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/2542">discussed and requested many times in the past</a> already. That is improved pack configuration.</p>

<p>Ready to automatically provision and maintain StackStorm nodes in production? Then the <code>stackstorm-st2</code> Puppet module is for you! We’re proud to announce the <code>v1.0.0</code> stable release of <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2</a>, the StackStorm Puppet module.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/puppet-st2"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Puppet is an excellent tool that allows the user to declare the desired state of their system in code. Once defined, hand over the reins to Puppet and watch as it transforms your nodes into what you’ve declared. We wanted to bring the power of declarative state to StackStorm deployments, and <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">puppet-st2</a> is that solution.</p>

<p>A great deal of work has gone into the <code>v1.0.0</code> release to ensure that <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/install/puppet.html">st2 Puppet Module</a> is ready to provision and manage StackStorm nodes in production environments. See January, 2018 <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2018/01/05/announcing-puppet-module-1-0-0-rc/">Puppet Module to Install StackStorm – Announcing Release Candidate</a>. Over the past year we’ve iterated through several pre-releases, release-candidate versions, fixed a lot of bugs, reworked the entire module structure and can now declare it stable and production ready.</p>

<p>So far StackStorm has multiple installation methods: deb/rpm packages, <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/index.html#ref-one-line-install"><code>curl|bash</code></a> installer used for simple deployments, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2-docker">Docker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/chef-stackstorm">Chef</a>.</p>
<p>Now it’s Puppet time!</p>
<p>Starting in July of 2017 a major effort has been underway to modernize the Puppet module to install/deploy StackStorm. In August of 2017 <code>v1.0.0-beta</code> was released with completely re-worked internals to support the new StackStorm <code>deb/rpm</code> package installation method and fix a large number of bugs. Since the beta we’ve continued development of new features like supporting all 4 StackStorm OSes, Puppet 4 and 5 compatibility, ChatOps installation and configuration, modernized pack management, full integration testing in Docker containers along with a slew of Puppet best practices improvements.</p>
<p>Today we’re proud to announce the Release Candidate version <code>v1.0.0-rc</code> of the <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2"><code>stackstorm-st2</code></a> Puppet module which is available on Forge.<br>
<a href="https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2"><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2<br>

Our plan is to release <code>v1.0.0</code> stable in the coming weeks, but in order to do this we need your help. We ask everyone who is interested in Puppet-based deployment to give the module a try and provide your feedback!</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2018/09/26/stackstorm-enterprise-ha-in-kubernetes-beta/">we released</a> the Helm chart and docker images so you could install StackStorm Enterprise HA cluster in Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Today, we’re glad to announce that the Community free and open source edition of StackStorm HA is now available, too! With this update we are excited to bring Kubernetes powers to the broader community and strive for greater adoption in production with better safety for all important operations you delegate to StackStorm automation engine.</p>

<p>More groups are progressing from just talking about Event-Driven Automation to actually doing it in practice. StackStorm helps make this easy. When organizations start offloading business-critical tasks and automating for real it becomes essential to ensure that the Automation engine itself is not a single point of failure when it is responsible for recovering a fleet of servers, managing datacenters, and automating remediations.</p>
<p>StackStorm was designed to be cloud-native, API-driven, easily deployed, microservice-oriented, resilient and can be scaled out horizontally to fulfill High Availability and/or High Load demands.</p>
<p>Previously we only documented best practices describing how to distribute StackStorm in HA mode (<a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html">docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html</a>), giving a high level overview regarding StackStorm design and how to ensure its redundancy. Based on those recommendations, some companies were spending weeks to months to codify a complex st2 HA infrastructure and iterate over their deployments until finding that “silver bullet” stability/production state.</p>

<p>The last couple of months, since the <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/03/29/stackstorm-joining-brocade/">Brocade acquisition</a>, have been pretty busy for us here at StackStorm. We have been getting to know our new friends at Brocade, learning the typical networking use-cases and figuring out how we can use StackStorm to automate them and bring all the DevOps and data-center automation goodness to the networking space, while keeping StackStorm a generic DevOps automation platform.</p>
<p>As always, we have continued to support our users and the community. We also haven’t been slacking with the StackStorm feature development and improvements. We have worked hard to bring you two new releases in the last 2 months – <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/04/20/stackstorm-v1-4/">StackStorm v1.4</a> and <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">StackStorm v1.5</a>.</p>
<p>StackStorm v1.5 which has been released just recently includes many new features and improvements so if you haven’t already, I would encourage you to go <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Today I will talk about the one of the major new features in StackStorm v1.5 which has been <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/2542">discussed and requested many times in the past</a> already. That is improved pack configuration.</p>

<p>ChatOps — a concept where a chat bot acts as a control plane for your operations — has always been a core part of StackStorm. It adds context to your actions, automates routine tasks nobody likes, helps team members communicate better and learn from each other, and sometimes it’s just plain fun. If you’re new to this, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37LmuHToYjQ">DevOps Next Steps talk</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jfryman">James Fryman</a>, and if you’ve been writing Eggdrop scripts in IRC since you were five but never used it in your daily operations, you might also get inspired from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw">ChatOps at GitHub talk</a> by Jesse Newland.</p>
<p>Today, we’re all excited to introduce — as a part of our <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v1.2.0">1.2.0 release</a> — a completely revamped ChatOps feature list. If you’re already using our Hubot integration to execute StackStorm actions from chat, stop doing whatever it is you’re doing and update! If not, it’s a good time to get started: ChatOps is the way of the future, now more than ever.</p>

<p>Time and time again, we hear of companies achieving rapid acceleration with DevOps. Companies are touting success with the metric of deploys/day, sharing new baselines of 10, 50 or even 100 deploys/day. In more mature organizations the likes of LinkedIn, Netflix, Etsy, Facebook and others, this number is a startling 1,000+ number. But, what does this even mean?</p>
<p>Unpacking this number is often one IT leaders stumble on, and is the greatest source of pushback when talking about rapid acceleration. How stable is the software being delivered? How many of these deployments are successful? What constitutes a deployment?</p>
<p>These questions and more often end up creating analysis paralysis, and nothing changes. In fact, the most common response starts with, “There is no way we could implement something like that at my company because…” We know this to be false. Companies who have traditionally delivered in a waterfall fashion with a single, bloated deploy per month or quarter are successfully transitioning to rapid deployment posting similar baseline numbers as other teams.</p>
<p>How then can you be successful in beginning software delivery? There is no single silver bullet or magic wand, but there is a fairly prescriptive methodology for achieving our goal of rapid delivery. Let’s dive in and take a look on how to get started.</p>

<h6 id="introduction">Introduction</h6>
<p>The StackStorm community repo has a rich integration pack for EC2 and Route53 action that you can find inside the <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. These actions are incredibly useful but they are just the building blocks. The real power of using StackStorm actions comes when they are stitched together into workflows. I’ve taken the two basic workflows we use for EC2 instance lifecycle management and genericized them, then added them to the AWS integration pack. I’m going to go over how these can be used to greatly simplify creation and termination of instances.</p>
<h6 id="why">Why?</h6>
<p>At StackStorm we needed a way to rapidly provision VMs that had all of our bootstrapping done…and it had to be easy to do from the command line or StackStorm UI. This version of the workflow has been simplified to remove some of our internal bootstrapping steps but still reduces the entire process of instance creation, DNS registration, and basic bootstrapping to a single command.</p>

<p>As an entrepreneur betting heavily – in time, money, and relationships – on OpenStack, I’m biased towards its success and more than a little interested in how it is growing up. I have long believed in open infrastructure and remain convinced that OpenStack is the best chance we all have for a future of greater innovation, quality, capability, and, yes, affordability for cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>I first looked at OpenStack a number of years ago when growing Nexenta and creating a market we then called the OpenStorage market, and recently took some time to look at the entire project and how far it’s come, as well as some emerging challenges.</p>

<p>More groups are progressing from just talking about Event-Driven Automation to actually doing it in practice. StackStorm helps make this easy. When organizations start offloading business-critical tasks and automating for real it becomes essential to ensure that the Automation engine itself is not a single point of failure when it is responsible for recovering a fleet of servers, managing datacenters, and automating remediations.</p>
<p>StackStorm was designed to be cloud-native, API-driven, easily deployed, microservice-oriented, resilient and can be scaled out horizontally to fulfill High Availability and/or High Load demands.</p>
<p>Previously we only documented best practices describing how to distribute StackStorm in HA mode (<a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html">docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html</a>), giving a high level overview regarding StackStorm design and how to ensure its redundancy. Based on those recommendations, some companies were spending weeks to months to codify a complex st2 HA infrastructure and iterate over their deployments until finding that “silver bullet” stability/production state.</p>

<p>What is StackStorm going to do with network automation? Ever since we joined Brocade, it’s been everyone’s question, and we have been hand-waving some answers. But the talk walks, code talks: let’s show something really working. Today’s example is on Docker network automation, where StackStorm makes physical networking follow Docker containers as they get created.</p>
<p>Millennial kids should watch my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9G71Ow6GUs">video with detailed explanations on StackStorm’s YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>True hackers might jump straight to <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/dockernetwork-vdx-demo">automation code on GitHub</a> to see how it is built and try it out on your StackStorm instance.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we cover CI part of CICD with Docker as an example. At a high level, this blog post will demonstrate how to create a docker image and push it to a registry on every commit to a github repo. You have probably read our own James Fryman’s excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on continuous delivery with StackStorm in a more traditional environment. If not, I highly recommend reading it. Also, this recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from docker is a great introduction to using docker in continuous delivery. Before diving into the details, below is some motivation for switching to container based immutable infrastructure.</p>

<p>As Michael Dehaan of Ansible fame notes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->immutable infrastructure is the way of the future<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Containers (especially, Docker) facilitate this by offering users a way to define their infrastructure through simple files (Dockerfile, for example). The role of orchestration tools changes when dealing with immutable infrastructure. A relevant quote from Michael Dehaan’s blog:</p>

<p>The pattern is the same: “I can’t because we don’t…”, “But we are also…”, “Can I …”, and finally “How do I get it?”</p>
<p>We’re demonstrating Brocade Workflow Composer (BWC), powered by <a href="http://stackstorm.com">StackStorm</a>, at <a href="http://www.brocade.com/en/about-us/events/sc16.html">SuperComputing16</a> in Salt Lake City. When you stop by booth 1131, we will give you a token of our appreciation. It’s an NodeMCU microcontroller. It’s pretty cool – WiFi built in, ARM microcontroller, lots of GPIO pins, and it can easily be programmed using the freely-available Arduino IDE. It gets you into the world of IoT quickly and easily, and it’s a lot of fun! Bonus!</p>
<p>But there is a catch – you have to watch a demo to get it.</p>

<p>Lights flashing at the StackStorm-Brocade booth made event-driven automation feel real with the IoT demo entertaining enterprise and DevOps crowds alike. Mirantis’ talk about auto-healing Symantec OpenStack cloud with StackStorm sparkled hallway conversations about auto-remediation. Our guerrilla hacking challenge was success, unveiled that the best hackers are all co-located…(guess where, anyone?)</p>

      <p>Run <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange</a> actions as AWS Lambda functions. Serverless and Stormless. 100% Open Source.</p>
<p><em>December 14, 2017</em><br>
<em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/dzimine">Dmitri Zimine</a></em></p>
<p><a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange</a> is an open source catalog of reusable actions. Integrations with everything ranging from common-man DevOps tools, suit and tie services like ServiceNow and Remedy to cool kids like Slack or Twilio, to more exotic systems like HUE Lights and Tesla cars. At the time of writing, there are 6500+ actions spread across 130 integration packs. It is Open Source, with a great community of maintainers. Something that makes StackStorm a great wiring tool to build automations integrating a wide breadth of domains.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But if you’ve taken a red pill and gone wholesale on AWS running serverless, deploying <a href="https://stackstorm.com/">StackStorm</a> may be not an option. Yet the catalog of reusable functions to integrate with commonly used services is an appealing idea. C’mon there should be 1000 Slack lambdas and 10,000 Twilio lambdas out there already, it doesn’t feel creative to write 10,001? Jealous to Azure with their <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/apis-list#popular-connectors">great library of reusable connectors</a>? Why can’t YOU grab something ready-to-use?</p>
<p>Now you can! Run StackStorm Exchange actions as lambda functions. Without StackStorm. <strong>Serverless and Stormless.</strong></p>

<p>StackStorm pack management infrastructure is evolving with the demand. As the number of integration packs grows, we want to provide means for faster and easier deployment, make pack development more productive, and encourage collaboration. There are dozens of changes making it happen—both in our internal infrastructure and the StackStorm core—and we are excited and hopeful that through better experience with integration packs, working with StackStorm will become even more efficient, easy, and fun.</p>
<p>As it is the case with all “thematic” releases, 2.1 is more than just a set of features and changes. It has a lot of context around it, and more importantly, it has a story—and this is a story we are now going to tell.</p>

<p>Your stories – and your ingenuity in wiring your environments together – have inspired us to build something truly different with StackStorm in order to help us all wire our environments together without incurring the massive technical debt of purely home built solutions. In the months since open-sourcing StackStorm late last year, the response has been almost overwhelming with downloads now in the tens of thousands per month, and recently doubling month over month over month.</p>

The 2020 ChatOps User Survey is here! This is your chance to submit your feedback on using ChatOps with StackStorm – what we get right, what we get wrong, and what we need to focus on.
We will use this feedback to chart the development roadmap for ChatOps, whether that means leaving st2chatops as-is, or focusing on supporting more chat providers, deeper feature support for specific providers, improving ChatOps integration with the rest of StackStorm (RBAC for ChatOps!

<p>The DevOps movement is focused on leading transformational change and driving innovation.

<p>We love our users. We love them even when they report bugs. We love them <strong>because</strong> they report bugs. But we <strong>really, really</strong> love our users when they report bugs, along with complete configurations, how to reproduce the bug, and logs. Recently <a href="https://github.com/bri365">Brian Martin</a> did just this, helping us resolve a tricky deadlock bug. Thank you Brian!</p>
<h2 id="tracking-down-deadlocks">Tracking down Deadlocks</h2>
<p>When you’re investigating a bug report, the first thing you want to do is to try to reproduce it. This helps you see what’s going on, and it gives you a clear test case to see if you’ve resolved it. Deadlocks &amp; race conditions can be horrible bugs to work with, as they are often difficult to reproduce. They might depend upon your hardware resources, or what other jobs are running at the same time. Even reproducing it on the exact same setup is tough.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we cover CI part of CICD with Docker as an example. At a high level, this blog post will demonstrate how to create a docker image and push it to a registry on every commit to a github repo. You have probably read our own James Fryman’s excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on continuous delivery with StackStorm in a more traditional environment. If not, I highly recommend reading it. Also, this recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from docker is a great introduction to using docker in continuous delivery. Before diving into the details, below is some motivation for switching to container based immutable infrastructure.</p>

<p>As Michael Dehaan of Ansible fame notes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->immutable infrastructure is the way of the future<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Containers (especially, Docker) facilitate this by offering users a way to define their infrastructure through simple files (Dockerfile, for example). The role of orchestration tools changes when dealing with immutable infrastructure. A relevant quote from Michael Dehaan’s blog:</p>

<p>More groups are progressing from just talking about Event-Driven Automation to actually doing it in practice. StackStorm helps make this easy. When organizations start offloading business-critical tasks and automating for real it becomes essential to ensure that the Automation engine itself is not a single point of failure when it is responsible for recovering a fleet of servers, managing datacenters, and automating remediations.</p>
<p>StackStorm was designed to be cloud-native, API-driven, easily deployed, microservice-oriented, resilient and can be scaled out horizontally to fulfill High Availability and/or High Load demands.</p>
<p>Previously we only documented best practices describing how to distribute StackStorm in HA mode (<a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html">docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html</a>), giving a high level overview regarding StackStorm design and how to ensure its redundancy. Based on those recommendations, some companies were spending weeks to months to codify a complex st2 HA infrastructure and iterate over their deployments until finding that “silver bullet” stability/production state.</p>

<p>The DevOps movement is focused on leading transformational change and driving innovation. At the recent DevOps Enterprise Summit in San Francisco, many of the leaders in the field spoke of driving change through a culture focused on collaboration, community, co-creation, curiosity, continual learning, designing for joy, and meaningful work. I have been impressed with the passion and conviction that leaders in the DevOps movement speak about and emphasize these key principles.. Through determination and focus, living out these key values, and recognizing that everyone has a role to play—we will be able to truly unlock the power of technology to address the many complex global challenges we face today.</p>
<p>An excellent example of leveraging DevOps and technology to address complex global challenges is found in the field of Genomics Research. Through focus on the values spoken about by DevOps thought leaders and innovation at the speed of community—Science, Universities, Government, and Business, powered by advances in IT, are able to join forces to develop and evolve techniques that allow for the reading of the source code of biology—something that is incredibly complex and in parts extremely optimized. Through this important work, we are just beginning to unlock the secrets and miraculous mysteries to life on earth as we know it.</p>

<p>ChatOps is still a fresh and uncommon thing in the DevOps world, where work is brought into a shared chat room. You can run commands directly from chat and everyone in the chatroom can see the history of work being done, do the same, interact with each other and even learn.

<p>We have updated the PagerDuty pack to use the “pypd” library, maintained by PagerDuty. Previously we were using the “pygerduty” library, maintained by DropBox. Key point to note is that “pygerduty” uses version 1 of the PagerDuty API, and “pypd” uses version 2.</p>
<p>We needed to update to v2 because PagerDuty <a href="https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/api-v2-frequently-asked-questions">will not be supporting version 1 of their API</a> after July 6, 2017. As a consequence of the migration to the latest API, any existing Stackstorm and PagerDuty users should update their packs and configurations now.

<p>The last couple of months, since the <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/03/29/stackstorm-joining-brocade/">Brocade acquisition</a>, have been pretty busy for us here at StackStorm. We have been getting to know our new friends at Brocade, learning the typical networking use-cases and figuring out how we can use StackStorm to automate them and bring all the DevOps and data-center automation goodness to the networking space, while keeping StackStorm a generic DevOps automation platform.</p>
<p>As always, we have continued to support our users and the community. We also haven’t been slacking with the StackStorm feature development and improvements. We have worked hard to bring you two new releases in the last 2 months – <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/04/20/stackstorm-v1-4/">StackStorm v1.4</a> and <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">StackStorm v1.5</a>.</p>
<p>StackStorm v1.5 which has been released just recently includes many new features and improvements so if you haven’t already, I would encourage you to go <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Today I will talk about the one of the major new features in StackStorm v1.5 which has been <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/2542">discussed and requested many times in the past</a> already. That is improved pack configuration.</p>

<p>Dear stormers and friends!</p>
<p>We are almost ready with a new and quite exciting platform release. This is a big release and we are really looking forward to it, and you should, too – just check out <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org">exchange.stackstorm.org</a> to get excited about what is coming. As usual, you will soon see an announcement, a blog describing the highlights of what we’ve done, and a back-story on how and why we did it.</p>
<p>This, however, is an unusual “head’s up”. The changes around pack management we are introducing in 2.1 are so substantial that it’s fair to give you time to review the new features, read the <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">changelog</a>, and adjust your private packs or automation around StackStorm if needed. We’re inviting you to contribute – EASILY – by trying out the new functionality and sharing feedback, or helping us catch last-minute bugs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/reference/packmgmt.html">transition notes are drafted here</a>. The full list of changes is <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">in the change log</a>. Please help us improve the docs wherever you find them unclear, confusing or imprecise – we are actively testing as we write this.</p>
<p>The biggest change is introducing <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. All integration packs from st2contrib, as well as other packs scattered around, are being moved under <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. Once the transfer is complete, you will be submitting your new packs as PRs against <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator">StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator</a> repo, as described in <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator/README.md">README.md</a>. Making features and fixes on existing community packs will be much easier now that each pack is in it’s own GitHub repo.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-octopusdeploy">What is OctopusDeploy?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.octopusdeploy.com">Octopus Deploy</a> is an automated deployment tool for .NET and Windows environments.

<p>Octopus Deploy provides a rich system for Windows application deployments, but this is typically part of a wider DevOps process. Unlike StackStorm, it does not support closed-loop monitoring, remediation or infrastructure configuration and building, it does not integrate into configuration management tools (nor claim to).

<p>The pattern is the same: “I can’t because we don’t…”, “But we are also…”, “Can I …”, and finally “How do I get it?”</p>
<p>We’re demonstrating Brocade Workflow Composer (BWC), powered by <a href="http://stackstorm.com">StackStorm</a>, at <a href="http://www.brocade.com/en/about-us/events/sc16.html">SuperComputing16</a> in Salt Lake City. When you stop by booth 1131, we will give you a token of our appreciation. It’s an NodeMCU microcontroller. It’s pretty cool – WiFi built in, ARM microcontroller, lots of GPIO pins, and it can easily be programmed using the freely-available Arduino IDE. It gets you into the world of IoT quickly and easily, and it’s a lot of fun! Bonus!</p>
<p>But there is a catch – you have to watch a demo to get it.</p>

<p>More groups are progressing from just talking about Event-Driven Automation to actually doing it in practice. StackStorm helps make this easy.

<p>StackStorm was designed to be cloud-native, API-driven, easily deployed, microservice-oriented, resilient and can be scaled out horizontally to fulfill High Availability and/or High Load demands.</p>
<p>Previously we only documented best practices describing how to distribute StackStorm in HA mode (<a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html">docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html</a>), giving a high level overview regarding StackStorm design and how to ensure its redundancy. Based on those recommendations, some companies were spending weeks to months to codify a complex st2 HA infrastructure and iterate over their deployments until finding that “silver bullet” stability/production state.</p>

<p>In this blog, we show how to scale out a Docker Swarm Cluster based on container workload, so that you don’t over-provision your AWS cluster and pay for just enough instances to run your containers. Learn how we achieved this, watch the <em>2 min video</em> to see it in action. Read the blog for details. Grab our code recipe and adjust it to your liking and use to auto-scale your Swarm on AWS.</p>

<p>The agility at which the business can respond to real-life situations is proportional to the level of digitization that has been implemented in the business. For a business to nimble and agile, it is imperative that all the processes be delivered as a digital service that can be provisioned, monitored and remediated by an automation logic at the core of the business. The automation logic should follow the <a href="https://www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/glossary/m/mape_loop.html">Monitor, Assess, Plan and Execute (MAPE) loop</a> methodology to provide a complete closed-loop automation system for the digital business.

<em>by Igor Cherkaev aka eMptywee</em></p>
<p>Recently I’ve been playing around Stackstorm – a platform for integration and automation of day-to-day tasks, monitoring events, existing scripts and deployment tools.</p>
<p>I am going to explain how easy it is to wrap your daily tasks into Stackstorm actions and workflows and how to provide a simple way of execution for complex tasks.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking for a while and initially I was going to bring everything up in one blog post. But later, it didn’t seem like a good idea. That being said, I’d rather break it into multiple posts, no matter how many there would be. Anyway, it seems to me that it’d be more practical and easier to read and understand.</p>
<h2 id="nagios">Nagios</h2>
<p>Let’s start with integrating Nagios alerts into Stackstorm. Assuming that you already have Stackstorm version 1.2.0+ installed, configured and running, as well as there’s Nagios running somewhere else that is capable of processing alerts and handling events. If not, please, proceed to &lt;www.stackstorm.com&gt; and &lt;www.nagios.org&gt; (installation and initial configuration of these two tools is beyond the scope of this post). Both tools are open source and free to use and have extensive documentation on installation and basic configuration.</p>
<p>First of all, I was happy to find an existing Nagios integration pack <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-nagios">on StackStorm community repo</a>, but my joy ended really quickly as I found it not working. Secondly, <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/05/auto-remediation-out-of-disk-space/">this StackStorm tutorial</a> helped me to get started.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.perfsonar.net/">PerfSonar</a> is a super handy toolkit for measuring network performance between any two points. Combine this with the Guest VM built into the <a href="https://www.extremenetworks.com/product/slx-9850-router/">Extreme SLX series of switches,</a> and you can easily run performance tests between any two points on your network, measuring performance, latency, jitter, MTU, path taken, etc. Combine that with StackStorm, and you can easily run those tests from Slack. No need to even login to a switch.</p>
<h2 id="demo-network-performance-tests-via-slack">Demo: Network Performance Tests via Slack</h2>
<p>Check out the video here. From Slack, we can trigger different tests between any two switches – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iperf">performance</a>, <a href="http://software.internet2.edu/owamp/">one-way latency measurement</a>, or <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/tracepath">trace the path</a>, showing the path MTU.

<p>Recently we explained how to use <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/10/21/auto-remediation-stackstorm-splunk/"><strong>Syslog with Splunk &amp; StackStorm</strong></a> to auto-remediate a link going down on a switch. Splunk is a widely used log management tool but there’s also a popular open source alternative – <a href="https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack"><strong>Elastic Stack</strong></a> (formerly the ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana). So if you’re using the Elastic Stack, and are looking to automate event remediation in your environment, you’re at the right place!

<p>What is StackStorm going to do with network automation? Ever since we joined Brocade, it’s been everyone’s question, and we have been hand-waving some answers. But the talk walks, code talks: let’s show something really working. Today’s example is on Docker network automation, where StackStorm makes physical networking follow Docker containers as they get created.</p>
<p>Millennial kids should watch my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9G71Ow6GUs">video with detailed explanations on StackStorm’s YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>True hackers might jump straight to <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/dockernetwork-vdx-demo">automation code on GitHub</a> to see how it is built and try it out on your StackStorm instance.</p>
<p>Or, just read on.</p>

<p><a href="https://stackstorm.com/2017/10/26/stackstorm-2-5-hit-streets/">StackStorm 2.5</a>  introduces one of our most highly requested features: “<a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/inquiries.html">Inquiries</a>”. Inquiries are a way of “asking a question” in the middle of a workflow (Mistral or ActionChain), to get additional data before moving on.</p>
<p>For instance, while you can store service credentials in the StackStorm datastore and retrieve them using a Jinja snippet, some services require two-factor authentication. It’s necessary, therefore, to be able to pause the workflow at a certain point, and allow a human to “inject” this data into the workflow midstream. There are a number of other use cases for this functionality, including the simple “I’m about to do something stupid dangerous, should I proceed?”.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackstorm.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/swtn.gif"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Before we get into Inquiries and how they work, an important note: we’ve been working hard on making sure the new feature is useful for a variety of use cases, and as robust as possible. However, it is a complex and fairly low-level feature that has a lot of moving parts, and before recommending it for production use, we’d like to spend a release cycle gathering feedback on the API and the user experience. So, for 2.5, we would love for you to use this feature in your test/dev deployments of StackStorm and let us know what you think. Don’t worry, this is not going to stay “alpha” forever! We expect that it will be “production ready” in StackStorm 2.6, due to ship later this year.</p>

<p>The last couple of months, since the <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/03/29/stackstorm-joining-brocade/">Brocade acquisition</a>, have been pretty busy for us here at StackStorm. We have been getting to know our new friends at Brocade, learning the typical networking use-cases and figuring out how we can use StackStorm to automate them and bring all the DevOps and data-center automation goodness to the networking space, while keeping StackStorm a generic DevOps automation platform.</p>
<p>As always, we have continued to support our users and the community. We also haven’t been slacking with the StackStorm feature development and improvements. We have worked hard to bring you two new releases in the last 2 months – <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/04/20/stackstorm-v1-4/">StackStorm v1.4</a> and <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">StackStorm v1.5</a>.</p>
<p>StackStorm v1.5 which has been released just recently includes many new features and improvements so if you haven’t already, I would encourage you to go <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Today I will talk about the one of the major new features in StackStorm v1.5 which has been <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/2542">discussed and requested many times in the past</a> already. That is improved pack configuration.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-octopusdeploy">What is OctopusDeploy?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.octopusdeploy.com">Octopus Deploy</a> is an automated deployment tool for .NET and Windows environments. It has gained significant popularity amongst the .NET development community for it’s ease of use and integration into the Microsoft development ecosystem. OctopusDeploy enables users to automate deployment of applications, packages and tools to Windows environments.</p>
<h2 id="why-integrate-octopusdeploy-into-stackstorm">Why integrate OctopusDeploy into StackStorm?</h2>
<p>Octopus Deploy provides a rich system for Windows application deployments, but this is typically part of a wider DevOps process. Unlike StackStorm, it does not support closed-loop monitoring, remediation or infrastructure configuration and building, it does not integrate into configuration management tools (nor claim to). If you want to integrate OctopusDeploy from another tool, as part of a DevOps or environment tool you could</p>

<p>Ready to automatically provision and maintain StackStorm nodes in production? Then the <code>stackstorm-st2</code> Puppet module is for you! We’re proud to announce the <code>v1.0.0</code> stable release of <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2</a>, the StackStorm Puppet module.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/puppet-st2"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Puppet is an excellent tool that allows the user to declare the desired state of their system in code. Once defined, hand over the reins to Puppet and watch as it transforms your nodes into what you’ve declared. We wanted to bring the power of declarative state to StackStorm deployments, and <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">puppet-st2</a> is that solution.</p>

See January, 2018 <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2018/01/05/announcing-puppet-module-1-0-0-rc/">Puppet Module to Install StackStorm – Announcing Release Candidate</a>. Over the past year we’ve iterated through several pre-releases, release-candidate versions, fixed a lot of bugs, reworked the entire module structure and can now declare it stable and production ready.</p>

<p>To be a good Stormer is to be a good hacker. Not necessarily in the sense that you enjoy compromising unsuspecting grandmother’s laptop or a random web cam, but that you have a curiosity about how things work. This isn’t unique in the tech industry at large, and many security conferences exploit this curiosity for fun in the form of Capture The Flag (CTF) type problem solver games and various challenges. This year for OpenStack Summit we’ve built our own challenge for people to play. The main reason is because it’s just plain fun, but we also think it’s a great way to introduce people to the power of StackStorm. If you’re bent towards curiosity and if you are a hacker at heart, read on!</p>

<p>As an entrepreneur betting heavily – in time, money, and relationships – on OpenStack, I’m biased towards its success and more than a little interested in how it is growing up. I have long believed in open infrastructure and remain convinced that OpenStack is the best chance we all have for a future of greater innovation, quality, capability, and, yes, affordability for cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>I first looked at OpenStack a number of years ago when growing Nexenta and creating a market we then called the OpenStorage market, and recently took some time to look at the entire project and how far it’s come, as well as some emerging challenges.</p>

<p>The last couple of months, since the <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/03/29/stackstorm-joining-brocade/">Brocade acquisition</a>, have been pretty busy for us here at StackStorm. We have been getting to know our new friends at Brocade, learning the typical networking use-cases and figuring out how we can use StackStorm to automate them and bring all the DevOps and data-center automation goodness to the networking space, while keeping StackStorm a generic DevOps automation platform.</p>
<p>As always, we have continued to support our users and the community. We also haven’t been slacking with the StackStorm feature development and improvements. We have worked hard to bring you two new releases in the last 2 months – <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/04/20/stackstorm-v1-4/">StackStorm v1.4</a> and <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">StackStorm v1.5</a>.</p>
<p>StackStorm v1.5 which has been released just recently includes many new features and improvements so if you haven’t already, I would encourage you to go <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Today I will talk about the one of the major new features in StackStorm v1.5 which has been <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/2542">discussed and requested many times in the past</a> already. That is improved pack configuration.</p>

<em>By <a href="https://github.com/nmaludy">Nick Maludy</a> of <a href="http://www.encore.tech">Encore Technologies</a></em></p>
<p>So far StackStorm has multiple installation methods: deb/rpm packages, <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/index.html#ref-one-line-install"><code>curl|bash</code></a> installer used for simple deployments, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2-docker">Docker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/chef-stackstorm">Chef</a>.</p>
<p>Now it’s Puppet time!</p>
<p>Starting in July of 2017 a major effort has been underway to modernize the Puppet module to install/deploy StackStorm. In August of 2017 <code>v1.0.0-beta</code> was released with completely re-worked internals to support the new StackStorm <code>deb/rpm</code> package installation method and fix a large number of bugs. Since the beta we’ve continued development of new features like supporting all 4 StackStorm OSes, Puppet 4 and 5 compatibility, ChatOps installation and configuration, modernized pack management, full integration testing in Docker containers along with a slew of Puppet best practices improvements.</p>
<p>Today we’re proud to announce the Release Candidate version <code>v1.0.0-rc</code> of the <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2"><code>stackstorm-st2</code></a> Puppet module which is available on Forge.<br>
<a href="https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2"><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2<br>
</a><br>
Our plan is to release <code>v1.0.0</code> stable in the coming weeks, but in order to do this we need your help. We ask everyone who is interested in Puppet-based deployment to give the module a try and provide your feedback!</p>
<p>Keep reading to find out more details about what’s changed and where the project is heading.</p>

<p>It happened! 🎉 After a long wait, we’re more than excited to announce the StackStorm <code>v3.2.0</code> release.</p>
<p>The StackStorm project has had some turbulent times since the previous release almost one year ago. The new v3.2.0 version is the first release since the project <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2019/10/07/stackstorm-joins-the-linux-foundation/">joined the Linux Foundation</a>, formed new <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2020/02/20/stackstorm-governance-and-maintainers/">Governance</a>, and gathered a new team of <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/blob/master/OWNERS.md">Maintainers</a>. Considering the amount of changes happened, it looks like a big restart for the project.</p>
<p>It’s awesome for StackStorm to be under new governance. But that also means everything is on the Community’s shoulders now. And while it’s harder to rely only on the community’s efforts compared to the previously dedicated team of full-time employees, these days we’re observing increased number of contributors and interest from the larger organizations to adopt StackStorm Event Driven Automation and Automated Remediation. We hope this trend continues and we are striving for a better project future and further growth, together.</p>
<p>So what’s new in StackStorm 3.2.0?<br>
This version aggregated almost one hundred changes including bugfixes, new <a href="#pack-dependencies">Pack Dependencies</a>, <a href="#rhel-8-centos-8-support">RHEL 8 / CentOS 8 Support</a>, Orquesta <a href="#orquesta-retry">retry</a> and <a href="#orquesta-re-run">re-run</a> features, <a href="#chatops-refactoring">ChatOps updates</a>, <a href="#chatops-immutable-parameters">Immutable parameters in Action Aliases</a>, performance improvements, and more.</p>

      StackStorm v3.1 is now available. This new release is focused on stability and bug fixes.
 Update requests library to latest version (2.22.0) in requirements. Disallow “decrypt_kv” filter to be specified in the config for values that are marked as “secret: True” in the schema. Upgrade tooz library to latest stable version (1.65.0) so it uses latest version of grpcio library. Fix timeout handling in the Python runner. In some scenarios where action would time out before producing any output (stdout, stder), timeout was not correctly propagated to the user.

In the last couple of weeks StackStorm has published back-to-back releases. 2.10.2 is a traditional patch release from StackStorm, and you’ll find some of the highlights below. 2.10.3 and 2.9.3; however, are releases to address CVE-2019-9580. I want to thank Barak Tawily and Anna Tsibulskaya: the researchers who discovered and submitted a patch for the issue.
The issue found by Barak and Anna is an improper handling of CORS headers.

<p>Ready to automatically provision and maintain StackStorm nodes in production? Then the <code>stackstorm-st2</code> Puppet module is for you! We’re proud to announce the <code>v1.0.0</code> stable release of <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2</a>, the StackStorm Puppet module.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/puppet-st2"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Puppet is an excellent tool that allows the user to declare the desired state of their system in code. Once defined, hand over the reins to Puppet and watch as it transforms your nodes into what you’ve declared. We wanted to bring the power of declarative state to StackStorm deployments, and <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">puppet-st2</a> is that solution.</p>

<p>A great deal of work has gone into the <code>v1.0.0</code> release to ensure that <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/install/puppet.html">st2 Puppet Module</a> is ready to provision and manage StackStorm nodes in production environments. See January, 2018 <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2018/01/05/announcing-puppet-module-1-0-0-rc/">Puppet Module to Install StackStorm – Announcing Release Candidate</a>. Over the past year we’ve iterated through several pre-releases, release-candidate versions, fixed a lot of bugs, reworked the entire module structure and can now declare it stable and production ready.</p>

<p>So far StackStorm has multiple installation methods: deb/rpm packages, <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/index.html#ref-one-line-install"><code>curl|bash</code></a> installer used for simple deployments, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/st2-docker">Docker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/ansible-st2">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/chef-stackstorm">Chef</a>.</p>
<p>Now it’s Puppet time!</p>
<p>Starting in July of 2017 a major effort has been underway to modernize the Puppet module to install/deploy StackStorm. In August of 2017 <code>v1.0.0-beta</code> was released with completely re-worked internals to support the new StackStorm <code>deb/rpm</code> package installation method and fix a large number of bugs. Since the beta we’ve continued development of new features like supporting all 4 StackStorm OSes, Puppet 4 and 5 compatibility, ChatOps installation and configuration, modernized pack management, full integration testing in Docker containers along with a slew of Puppet best practices improvements.</p>
<p>Today we’re proud to announce the Release Candidate version <code>v1.0.0-rc</code> of the <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2"><code>stackstorm-st2</code></a> Puppet module which is available on Forge.<br>
<a href="https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2"><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2<br>
</a><br>
Our plan is to release <code>v1.0.0</code> stable in the coming weeks, but in order to do this we need your help. We ask everyone who is interested in Puppet-based deployment to give the module a try and provide your feedback!</p>

Just in case you missed it, we published StackStorm v2.1.1 late last week. This is a minor update, on top of the major changes to pack management we made with 2.1.
There’s a few small bugfixes and enhancements:
 core.http now supports HTTP basic auth and digest authentication. Local action runner supports unicode parameter keys and values. Improved error handling and more user-friendly messages for packs commands and APIs.

<p>Dear stormers and friends!</p>
<p>We are almost ready with a new and quite exciting platform release. This is a big release and we are really looking forward to it, and you should, too – just check out <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org">exchange.stackstorm.org</a> to get excited about what is coming. As usual, you will soon see an announcement, a blog describing the highlights of what we’ve done, and a back-story on how and why we did it.</p>
<p>This, however, is an unusual “head’s up”. The changes around pack management we are introducing in 2.1 are so substantial that it’s fair to give you time to review the new features, read the <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">changelog</a>, and adjust your private packs or automation around StackStorm if needed. We’re inviting you to contribute – EASILY – by trying out the new functionality and sharing feedback, or helping us catch last-minute bugs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/reference/packmgmt.html">transition notes are drafted here</a>. The full list of changes is <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">in the change log</a>. Please help us improve the docs wherever you find them unclear, confusing or imprecise – we are actively testing as we write this.</p>
<p>The biggest change is introducing <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. All integration packs from st2contrib, as well as other packs scattered around, are being moved under <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. Once the transfer is complete, you will be submitting your new packs as PRs against <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator">StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator</a> repo, as described in <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator/README.md">README.md</a>. Making features and fixes on existing community packs will be much easier now that each pack is in it’s own GitHub repo.</p>

<p>StackStorm Enterprise is back, and it’s now <strong>Brocade Workflow Composer</strong>. We’ve just shipped version 2.0. The platform has had a look &amp; feel update, the usual round of bugfixes and enhancements, and we’re introducing “Network Automation Suites” for our networking friends. More on those in a minute.</p>

<p>A good month after <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">releasing StackStorm v1.5.0</a> we are happy to announce the release of StackStorm v1.6.0.</p>
<p>This release includes various new features and improvements described below.</p>
<h2 id="concurrency-policy-improvements">Concurrency policy improvements</h2>
<p>We have listened to <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/2794">feedback from our users</a> and updated <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/policies.html#concurrency">action concurrency policies</a> to allow action execution to be canceled instead of just delayed when a concurrency threshold is reached.</p>
<p>This feature comes handy in situations where multiple users request the same action, but the action is already running because of the first request.</p>

<p><strong>StackStorm v1.5.0</strong> has been released! More features, more improvements, and more bugfixes (sorry about those). Read on to hear about the changes, or fire up <code>apt</code>/<code>yum</code> and upgrade!</p>
<h2 id="cli-completion">CLI Completion!</h2>
<p>Spend a lot of your time using the <code>st2</code> CLI? You’ll love this change: We’ve added CLI auto-completion to the <code>st2</code> command. Type <code>st2</code> then hit tab twice. You’ll get a list of all available arguments. This works multiple levels deep. Very handy when you can’t quite remember the right syntax:</p>

<p>Simple, but cool.</p>
<h2 id="datastore-secrets-and-user-scoping">Datastore Secrets and User-Scoping</h2>
<p>The StackStorm datastore service allows you to store common parameters and their values for reuse within sensors, actions and rules. Prior to v1.5, these were available to all users. Now you can scope variables to a specific user, and you can control who can read or write into those variables. By default, variables are stored in the <code>system</code> scope, but you can scope it to a specific user by adding <code>--scope=user</code>, e.g.:</p>
<p><code>st2 key set date_cmd &quot;date -u&quot; --scope=user</code></p>

Upgrade tooz library to latest stable version (1.65.0) so it uses latest version of grpcio library. Fix timeout handling in the Python runner. In some scenarios where action would time out before producing any output (stdout, stder), timeout was not correctly propagated to the user.

In the last couple of weeks StackStorm has published back-to-back releases. 2.10.2 is a traditional patch release from StackStorm, and you’ll find some of the highlights below. 2.10.3 and 2.9.3; however, are releases to address CVE-2019-9580. I want to thank Barak Tawily and Anna Tsibulskaya: the researchers who discovered and submitted a patch for the issue.
The issue found by Barak and Anna is an improper handling of CORS headers.

<p>Those two patch releases fix a security issue which has been reported to us this week by one of our users (Alexandre Juma – thanks!).</p>

<p>Thought you could wind down for the change freeze? Sorry, we’ve got one last thing for you to do: Upgrade StackStorm to 2.10! Orquesta is now ready for almost all workflow use-cases. We’ve also done a big update to our ChatOps internals, and we have early-access Ubuntu 18 + Python 3 packages (for test only!). Read on for full details:</p>

Quick note today: We quietly published StackStorm 2.4.1 last week. Nothing major, just a few bug fixes.
First one: Mistral shutdown with systemd is much faster. The issue has been resolved upstream. We’ve fixed a couple more Mistral-related issues, including better handling of Unicode results.
For our RBAC users, we have fixed a problem where the the system user was being used for pack installation, not the actual user who requested the pack install.

Just in case you missed it, we published StackStorm v2.1.1 late last week. This is a minor update, on top of the major changes to pack management we made with 2.1.
There’s a few small bugfixes and enhancements:
 core.http now supports HTTP basic auth and digest authentication. Local action runner supports unicode parameter keys and values. Improved error handling and more user-friendly messages for packs commands and APIs.

<p>Ta-da! It’s here! StackStorm version 2.1 has been released, and there are some big changes. So big that we started wondering if we should have called this release version 3.0. Pack management has had a <em>lot</em> of work done, and we think you’ll be pleased with the results. Plus good news for those patiently waiting for Ubuntu 16.04LTS support!</p>
<h2 id="packs-packs-packs8230its-mostly-all-about-packs">Packs Packs Packs…it’s (mostly) all about Packs</h2>

<p>Dear stormers and friends!</p>
<p>We are almost ready with a new and quite exciting platform release. This is a big release and we are really looking forward to it, and you should, too – just check out <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org">exchange.stackstorm.org</a> to get excited about what is coming. As usual, you will soon see an announcement, a blog describing the highlights of what we’ve done, and a back-story on how and why we did it.</p>
<p>This, however, is an unusual “head’s up”. The changes around pack management we are introducing in 2.1 are so substantial that it’s fair to give you time to review the new features, read the <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">changelog</a>, and adjust your private packs or automation around StackStorm if needed. We’re inviting you to contribute – EASILY – by trying out the new functionality and sharing feedback, or helping us catch last-minute bugs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/reference/packmgmt.html">transition notes are drafted here</a>. The full list of changes is <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/upgrade_notes.html#st2-in-development">in the change log</a>. Please help us improve the docs wherever you find them unclear, confusing or imprecise – we are actively testing as we write this.</p>
<p>The biggest change is introducing <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. All integration packs from st2contrib, as well as other packs scattered around, are being moved under <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. Once the transfer is complete, you will be submitting your new packs as PRs against <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator">StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator</a> repo, as described in <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/exchange-incubator/README.md">README.md</a>. Making features and fixes on existing community packs will be much easier now that each pack is in it’s own GitHub repo.</p>

This is primarily a bug-fix release which includes bug fixes and improvements for some of the features which have been introduced in StackStorm v1.5.0.
Release Highlights  Fix trigger registration when using st2-register-content script with –register-triggers flag. Fix an issue with CronTimer sometimes not firing due to TriggerInstance creation failure. Add support for default values when a new pack configuration is used.

<p>In <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2017/10/05/event-grid-event-gateway-explained-part1/">Part 1</a> of the series, I shared my excitement with two new event-driven systems introduced last month: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Event Grid<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Microsoft Azure and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Event Gateway<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Serverless.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and posted some observations on Event Grid.</p>

<p>Ready to automatically provision and maintain StackStorm nodes in production? Then the <code>stackstorm-st2</code> Puppet module is for you! We’re proud to announce the <code>v1.0.0</code> stable release of <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2</a>, the StackStorm Puppet module.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stackstorm/puppet-st2"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Puppet is an excellent tool that allows the user to declare the desired state of their system in code. Once defined, hand over the reins to Puppet and watch as it transforms your nodes into what you’ve declared. We wanted to bring the power of declarative state to StackStorm deployments, and <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/puppet-st2">puppet-st2</a> is that solution.</p>

<p>A great deal of work has gone into the <code>v1.0.0</code> release to ensure that <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/install/puppet.html">st2 Puppet Module</a> is ready to provision and manage StackStorm nodes in production environments. See January, 2018 <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2018/01/05/announcing-puppet-module-1-0-0-rc/">Puppet Module to Install StackStorm – Announcing Release Candidate</a>. Over the past year we’ve iterated through several pre-releases, release-candidate versions, fixed a lot of bugs, reworked the entire module structure and can now declare it stable and production ready.</p>

<p>The last couple of months, since the <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/03/29/stackstorm-joining-brocade/">Brocade acquisition</a>, have been pretty busy for us here at StackStorm. We have been getting to know our new friends at Brocade, learning the typical networking use-cases and figuring out how we can use StackStorm to automate them and bring all the DevOps and data-center automation goodness to the networking space, while keeping StackStorm a generic DevOps automation platform.</p>
<p>As always, we have continued to support our users and the community. We also haven’t been slacking with the StackStorm feature development and improvements. We have worked hard to bring you two new releases in the last 2 months – <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/04/20/stackstorm-v1-4/">StackStorm v1.4</a> and <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">StackStorm v1.5</a>.</p>
<p>StackStorm v1.5 which has been released just recently includes many new features and improvements so if you haven’t already, I would encourage you to go <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/06/27/stackstorm-v1-5-alive/">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Today I will talk about the one of the major new features in StackStorm v1.5 which has been <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/2542">discussed and requested many times in the past</a> already. That is improved pack configuration.</p>

In the last couple of weeks StackStorm has published back-to-back releases. 2.10.2 is a traditional patch release from StackStorm, and you’ll find some of the highlights below. 2.10.3 and 2.9.3; however, are releases to address CVE-2019-9580. I want to thank Barak Tawily and Anna Tsibulskaya: the researchers who discovered and submitted a patch for the issue.
The issue found by Barak and Anna is an improper handling of CORS headers.

<p>I’ve done a couple articles about getting StackStorm set up, an introductory video, and put a fair amount of effort towards minimizing the barrier to entry for new users.  Overall, I think StackStorm was successful in providing a quick and easy way to get our system up and running but users need more than that.  Users need to see how StackStorm can help solve their specific pain points.  We needed a way to illustrate that we can provide an easy to use solution without the steep learning curve of throwing out your existing tools.  Over a series of a few blog posts we are going to go over some of the ways that we have leveraged the StackStorm platform internally and how these solutions could map to your environment.</p>

<p>The DevOps movement is focused on leading transformational change and driving innovation. At the recent DevOps Enterprise Summit in San Francisco, many of the leaders in the field spoke of driving change through a culture focused on collaboration, community, co-creation, curiosity, continual learning, designing for joy, and meaningful work. I have been impressed with the passion and conviction that leaders in the DevOps movement speak about and emphasize these key principles.. Through determination and focus, living out these key values, and recognizing that everyone has a role to play—we will be able to truly unlock the power of technology to address the many complex global challenges we face today.</p>
<p>An excellent example of leveraging DevOps and technology to address complex global challenges is found in the field of Genomics Research. Through focus on the values spoken about by DevOps thought leaders and innovation at the speed of community—Science, Universities, Government, and Business, powered by advances in IT, are able to join forces to develop and evolve techniques that allow for the reading of the source code of biology—something that is incredibly complex and in parts extremely optimized. Through this important work, we are just beginning to unlock the secrets and miraculous mysteries to life on earth as we know it.</p>

<p><a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange</a> is an open source catalog of reusable actions. Integrations with everything ranging from common-man DevOps tools, suit and tie services like ServiceNow and Remedy to cool kids like Slack or Twilio, to more exotic systems like HUE Lights and Tesla cars. At the time of writing, there are 6500+ actions spread across 130 integration packs. It is Open Source, with a great community of maintainers. Something that makes StackStorm a great wiring tool to build automations integrating a wide breadth of domains.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But if you’ve taken a red pill and gone wholesale on AWS running serverless, deploying <a href="https://stackstorm.com/">StackStorm</a> may be not an option. Yet the catalog of reusable functions to integrate with commonly used services is an appealing idea. C’mon there should be 1000 Slack lambdas and 10,000 Twilio lambdas out there already, it doesn’t feel creative to write 10,001? Jealous to Azure with their <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/apis-list#popular-connectors">great library of reusable connectors</a>? Why can’t YOU grab something ready-to-use?</p>
<p>Now you can! Run StackStorm Exchange actions as lambda functions. Without StackStorm. <strong>Serverless and Stormless.</strong></p>

<p>Your stories – and your ingenuity in wiring your environments together – have inspired us to build something truly different with StackStorm in order to help us all wire our environments together without incurring the massive technical debt of purely home built solutions. In the months since open-sourcing StackStorm late last year, the response has been almost overwhelming with downloads now in the tens of thousands per month, and recently doubling month over month over month.</p>

<p>ChatOps — a concept where a chat bot acts as a control plane for your operations — has always been a core part of StackStorm. It adds context to your actions, automates routine tasks nobody likes, helps team members communicate better and learn from each other, and sometimes it’s just plain fun. If you’re new to this, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37LmuHToYjQ">DevOps Next Steps talk</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jfryman">James Fryman</a>, and if you’ve been writing Eggdrop scripts in IRC since you were five but never used it in your daily operations, you might also get inspired from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw">ChatOps at GitHub talk</a> by Jesse Newland.</p>
<p>Today, we’re all excited to introduce — as a part of our <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v1.2.0">1.2.0 release</a> — a completely revamped ChatOps feature list. If you’re already using our Hubot integration to execute StackStorm actions from chat, stop doing whatever it is you’re doing and update! If not, it’s a good time to get started: ChatOps is the way of the future, now more than ever.</p>

<p>ChatOps brings the context of work you are already doing into the conversations you are already having. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jfryman<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>ChatOps is still a fresh and uncommon thing in the DevOps world, where work is brought into a shared chat room. You can run commands directly from chat and everyone in the chatroom can see the history of work being done, do the same, interact with each other and even learn. The information and process is owned by the entire team which brings a lot of benefits.</p>

You might prefer to <a href="docs.stackstorm.com/packs.html">read the documentation</a> if that is not what you are into.

<p>A little while ago we <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/12/06/2-1-new-pack-management/">rolled out StackStorm 2.1</a>, a release focused on one primary theme: integration packs.</p>
<p>StackStorm pack management infrastructure is evolving with the demand. As the number of integration packs grows, we want to provide means for faster and easier deployment, make pack development more productive, and encourage collaboration. There are dozens of changes making it happen—both in our internal infrastructure and the StackStorm core—and we are excited and hopeful that through better experience with integration packs, working with StackStorm will become even more efficient, easy, and fun.</p>
<p>As it is the case with all “thematic” releases, 2.1 is more than just a set of features and changes. It has a lot of context around it, and more importantly, it has a story—and this is a story we are now going to tell.</p>

<p>At DevOps Enterprise Summit 2016, DevOps leaders like Target, American Airlines, Disney, and Quicken Loans spoke of the importance of managing/optimizing operations, addressing technical debt, eliminating silos, collaboration, and the importance of open source and community to drive innovation. I was especially struck by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jason Cox of Disney<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who stressed the importance of “creating a culture of courage” where teams are encouraged to be curious, to experiment, explore and embrace change across process, roles, and technology-all for the purpose of enabling meaningful work.</p>
<p>It turns out that these themes are being talked about not only by these large Enterprise DevOps leaders. These themes are being repeated in conversations around the globe with IT leaders who are looking to leverage DevOps practices to successfully drive innovation and digital transformation.</p>
<p>Anthony Shaw, Group Director of Innovation and Technical Talent at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dimension Data<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has seen this first hand. Anthony not only leads innovation efforts within Dimension Data-but he also travels the world speaking with customers about their business priorities, their Digital Transformation goals, and how the innovative use of technology, organizational structure, community, and transforming day to day operational practices can accelerate their Digital Transformation journey.</p>

<p>The DevOps movement is focused on leading transformational change and driving innovation. At the recent DevOps Enterprise Summit in San Francisco, many of the leaders in the field spoke of driving change through a culture focused on collaboration, community, co-creation, curiosity, continual learning, designing for joy, and meaningful work. I have been impressed with the passion and conviction that leaders in the DevOps movement speak about and emphasize these key principles.. Through determination and focus, living out these key values, and recognizing that everyone has a role to play—we will be able to truly unlock the power of technology to address the many complex global challenges we face today.</p>
<p>An excellent example of leveraging DevOps and technology to address complex global challenges is found in the field of Genomics Research. Through focus on the values spoken about by DevOps thought leaders and innovation at the speed of community—Science, Universities, Government, and Business, powered by advances in IT, are able to join forces to develop and evolve techniques that allow for the reading of the source code of biology—something that is incredibly complex and in parts extremely optimized. Through this important work, we are just beginning to unlock the secrets and miraculous mysteries to life on earth as we know it.</p>

When you stop by booth 1131, we will give you a token of our appreciation. It’s an NodeMCU microcontroller. It’s pretty cool – WiFi built in, ARM microcontroller, lots of GPIO pins, and it can easily be programmed using the freely-available Arduino IDE. It gets you into the world of IoT quickly and easily, and it’s a lot of fun! Bonus!</p>

<p>These days ChatOps has become all the rage. In this blog I’ll talk a little bit about how we came to be here – in a leading position when it comes to ChatOps adoption for operations. And I’ll point you to some resources from users and our own engineers to learn more.</p>
<p>The history lesson will be brief, I promise.</p>
<p>We started StackStorm after observing that existing solutions in the devops universe were generally point solutions, often evolved from scripts and other projects that DevOps engineers wrote to make their own lives easier. And that’s a great way to build a solution that appeals at least to those types of users for those specific use cases.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What we saw was that while there were leaders within certain segments amongst those tools, there was no clearly adopted pattern for the wiring that tied all these tools together. Moreover, with our backgrounds in enterprises we knew that wiring together extremely heterogeneous environments is always a challenge. The enterprise is more a brownfield than a greenfield.</p>
<p>A quick shout out to teams at Facebook and at WebEx Spark and all those other early interviewees that taught us so much about event driven automation. And if you want to join a non commercial Bay Area meet-up about the subject and hear speakers from organizations like Facebook and LinkedIn and Netflix, please join here:<br>

<p>In the post <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm QuickTip: ChatOps your pack dev workflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> James Fryman gave a ChatOPS alias recipe to reduce the friction for deploying packs and then in the <em>Random Thoughts</em> section asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This action is tied directly to the <code>packs.install</code>. What about a workflow? Seems like that would be a better way to structure this.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonated with me as I had already started working on an internal pack that did just that, as I thought attempting to deploy a pack via an alias (and action) contained within the same pack would be madness (or just lead to interesting race conditions). In the last week, our <em>Pull Request</em> has been merged, documentation has been included in st2docs (<a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/chatops/pack_deploy.html">link</a>) for a workflow that fulfils the above random thought and should be released with 1.4.</p>
<p>So introducing <code>packs.deploy</code>, an action written in Mistral to handle the mapping of names for Git repositories to the information required to carry out the <code>packs.install</code> action.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-octopusdeploy">What is OctopusDeploy?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.octopusdeploy.com">Octopus Deploy</a> is an automated deployment tool for .NET and Windows environments. It has gained significant popularity amongst the .NET development community for it’s ease of use and integration into the Microsoft development ecosystem. OctopusDeploy enables users to automate deployment of applications, packages and tools to Windows environments.</p>
<h2 id="why-integrate-octopusdeploy-into-stackstorm">Why integrate OctopusDeploy into StackStorm?</h2>
<p>Octopus Deploy provides a rich system for Windows application deployments, but this is typically part of a wider DevOps process. Unlike StackStorm, it does not support closed-loop monitoring, remediation or infrastructure configuration and building, it does not integrate into configuration management tools (nor claim to). If you want to integrate OctopusDeploy from another tool, as part of a DevOps or environment tool you could</p>

<p>The DevOps movement is focused on leading transformational change and driving innovation. At the recent DevOps Enterprise Summit in San Francisco, many of the leaders in the field spoke of driving change through a culture focused on collaboration, community, co-creation, curiosity, continual learning, designing for joy, and meaningful work. I have been impressed with the passion and conviction that leaders in the DevOps movement speak about and emphasize these key principles.. Through determination and focus, living out these key values, and recognizing that everyone has a role to play—we will be able to truly unlock the power of technology to address the many complex global challenges we face today.</p>
<p>An excellent example of leveraging DevOps and technology to address complex global challenges is found in the field of Genomics Research. Through focus on the values spoken about by DevOps thought leaders and innovation at the speed of community—Science, Universities, Government, and Business, powered by advances in IT, are able to join forces to develop and evolve techniques that allow for the reading of the source code of biology—something that is incredibly complex and in parts extremely optimized. Through this important work, we are just beginning to unlock the secrets and miraculous mysteries to life on earth as we know it.</p>

When you stop by booth 1131, we will give you a token of our appreciation. It’s an NodeMCU microcontroller. It’s pretty cool – WiFi built in, ARM microcontroller, lots of GPIO pins, and it can easily be programmed using the freely-available Arduino IDE. It gets you into the world of IoT quickly and easily, and it’s a lot of fun! Bonus!</p>

<p>Our engineers hang out here from 9:00 -&gt; 17:00 PST, and often later. They’re happy to answer whatever questions you have. Just in the last few days, we’ve had questions about installation, ChatOps setup, writing sensors, purging history, creating actions, etc. Because the core engineers are involved in those discussions, not only can they help fix problems, they can also explain the design thinking.</p>

The 2020 ChatOps User Survey is here! This is your chance to submit your feedback on using ChatOps with StackStorm – what we get right, what we get wrong, and what we need to focus on.
We will use this feedback to chart the development roadmap for ChatOps, whether that means leaving st2chatops as-is, or focusing on supporting more chat providers, deeper feature support for specific providers, improving ChatOps integration with the rest of StackStorm (RBAC for ChatOps!

Splunk is a widely used log management tool but there’s also a popular open source alternative – <a href="https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack"><strong>Elastic Stack</strong></a> (formerly the ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana). So if you’re using the Elastic Stack, and are looking to automate event remediation in your environment, you’re at the right place! In this post, we’re taking the same <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/10/21/auto-remediation-stackstorm-splunk/">use case as before</a> and talking about how to set up the Elastic stack to collect syslog data and trigger event-based network remediation workflows using <strong>StackStorm</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve done a couple articles about getting StackStorm set up, an introductory video, and put a fair amount of effort towards minimizing the barrier to entry for new users.  Overall, I think StackStorm was successful in providing a quick and easy way to get our system up and running but users need more than that.  Users need to see how StackStorm can help solve their specific pain points.  We needed a way to illustrate that we can provide an easy to use solution without the steep learning curve of throwing out your existing tools.  Over a series of a few blog posts we are going to go over some of the ways that we have leveraged the StackStorm platform internally and how these solutions could map to your environment.</p>

<p>ChatOps — a concept where a chat bot acts as a control plane for your operations — has always been a core part of StackStorm. It adds context to your actions, automates routine tasks nobody likes, helps team members communicate better and learn from each other, and sometimes it’s just plain fun. If you’re new to this, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37LmuHToYjQ">DevOps Next Steps talk</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jfryman">James Fryman</a>, and if you’ve been writing Eggdrop scripts in IRC since you were five but never used it in your daily operations, you might also get inspired from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw">ChatOps at GitHub talk</a> by Jesse Newland.</p>
<p>Today, we’re all excited to introduce — as a part of our <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v1.2.0">1.2.0 release</a> — a completely revamped ChatOps feature list. If you’re already using our Hubot integration to execute StackStorm actions from chat, stop doing whatever it is you’re doing and update! If not, it’s a good time to get started: ChatOps is the way of the future, now more than ever.</p>

<p>A host is running out of disk space. What follows is a routine pager panic and rush in cleaning things up, at best. At worst, downtime. It is silly, but it happens much more than most of us care to admit.</p>
<p>This, and many other annoying events like this can, and shall be auto-remediated. The “classic” pattern of wiring monitoring to and paging is simply not good enough, and know it when you’re paged at 3am to clean the disk on production server.</p>
<p>And to those of you who hard-wire their remediation scripts into Nagios/Sensu event handlers, Splunk alert scripts and NewRelic web hooks: it is plain wrong there’s a better way.</p>
<p>In this blog, we show how StackStorm auto-remediation platform helps you hand out-of-disk case, with step-by-step walk-through and a working automation sample to kick-start your auto-remediation.</p>

<p>A StackStorm user with large investment in Java asked us: “Can I turn my Java code into StackStorm actions, and how?”</p>
<p>The answer is “<strong>Yes you can</strong>, in three basic steps”:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol>
<li>Wrap the Java code in a Java console application;</li>
<li>Take the input as command line arguments</li>
<li>For the best results, output formatted JSON to stdout/stderr – this way StackStorm will auto-parse it so that you reference them with <code>dotted.notation</code> in workflows.</li>

<p>The task at hand is to connect Stackstorm to your pre-existing Saltstack infrastructure. Why? Well, by doing this you can turn all of your existing Salt actions into StackStorm actions, allowing you to use StackStorm for your overall event driven automation while Salt remains focused on remote execution and other use cases. This is a pattern we are increasingly seeing – so let’s try it out!</p>
<p>This blog covers both proper configuration of Saltstack NetAPI allowing for Stackstorm usage as well as how to install and configure the salt pack within StackStorm. This tutorial covers <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-salt#scenario-2-st2-using-salt-netapi">Scenario 2 listed on the Salt pack README</a>.</p>

        Automated Troubleshooting With StackStorm and Mistral

<p>Recently someone on #stackstorm IRC asked how to build a simple troubleshooting automation: <em>“on cron, ping a server, and dump the stats to the log for analytics; post the failure to Slack immediately if the ping fails.”</em> Our short answer was <em>“use Mistral workflow”.</em> In this post, I’ll use this simple case to walk you through the details of setting up a basic automation, powered by Mistral workflow.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openstack/mistral">Mistral</a> is a workflow service that we help develop upstream in OpenStack. It gives features and reliability that are missing in simple workflows like our own ActionChain or Ansible’s (details in <a href="http://stackstorm.com/2015/04/10/the-return-of-workflows/">“Return of workflows”</a>). Mistral comes embedded and supported with StackStorm.</p>
<p>The scenario I use here is obviously simplification: in a typical deployment, monitoring is set up to do heavy-lifting on issue identifications, and a variety of devops tools are used to troubleshoot and remediate issues. StackStorm gives a <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org">fair bunch of lego-blocks</a> to integrate existing devops tools, and build more realistic automation workflows. Yet, the production development flow and the patterns are going to be just as in this simple example.</p>
<p>I’ll take an opportunity to go over some basics of using StackStorm. It’s all <a href="http://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/">documented</a>, but doesn’t hurt to repeat some in context, and share my tips and tricks.</p>
<p>For you impatient kinds: the final version is available as a pack on GitHub, <a href="#install_example">made-ready to install</a>.</p>

<p>In order to unleash the true power of StackStorm, a good first step is to learn about actions. Actions are the cornerstone of the StackStorm system, representing what we commonly refer to as ‘lego bricks’. Actions are what StackStorm ties together to compose complex workflows to drive even the most complex cases.</p>
<p>Today, we will explore actions within StackStorm. By the end of this article, you’ll have a great understanding of how…</p>
<ul>
<li>to understand and create action metadata files.</li>
<li>and when to use each of the action runner types.</li>
<li>to create actions that execute code in any language.</li>
<li>to create actions using native Python hooks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Day in and day out, the team at StackStorm is building tools that take away pain from the daily lives of Operations and Developers in IT Departments everywhere. We do this by focusing our efforts on absorbing all the Glue Code, the small snippets of code that tie together tools in your organization, and relieving the developer and operator of much of the traditional management overhead associated with automations. We also need to make sure that the tools we provide <em>around</em> StackStorm are equally enjoyable and frictionless to use. To that end, I would like to share with you how to rapidly build integrations with our integrated development environment, <code>st2workroom</code>.</p>

<h6 id="introduction">Introduction</h6>
<p>The StackStorm community repo has a rich integration pack for EC2 and Route53 action that you can find inside the <a href="https://exchange.stackstorm.org/">StackStorm Exchange</a>. These actions are incredibly useful but they are just the building blocks. The real power of using StackStorm actions comes when they are stitched together into workflows. I’ve taken the two basic workflows we use for EC2 instance lifecycle management and genericized them, then added them to the AWS integration pack. I’m going to go over how these can be used to greatly simplify creation and termination of instances.</p>
<h6 id="why">Why?</h6>
<p>At StackStorm we needed a way to rapidly provision VMs that had all of our bootstrapping done…and it had to be easy to do from the command line or StackStorm UI. This version of the workflow has been simplified to remove some of our internal bootstrapping steps but still reduces the entire process of instance creation, DNS registration, and basic bootstrapping to a single command.</p>

So if you’re using the Elastic Stack, and are looking to automate event remediation in your environment, you’re at the right place!

<em>by Dmitri Zimine</em></p>
<p>I set up a sensor to watch for a trigger (trigger represents an external event; sensor will fire a trigger-instance of the trigger type when the event is detected). I created a rule: if the trigger happens, and matches the criteria, it should fire an action. I see that event had happened. I expected the actions to fire. But it didn’t happen. Where did it break?</p>
<p>This is a long read, and may look complicated. But really, it’s just <em>three debugging steps</em>. And it’s long because I refuse to write briefly, drop bunch of hints on the way and get you distracted. But as they say in math, the thicker the math book the faster it reads. <strong>Brace yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>In the example below, I’ll be showing you how we debugged our Twitter automation that scans tweets for mentions and posts it to Slack. A pretty good way to keep track on who is trash talking about us! The debugging “runbook” is generic and applies to troubleshooting other rules just fine.</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the trigger chain and review how it works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ChatOps brings the context of work you are already doing into the conversations you are already having. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jfryman<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatOps is still a fresh and uncommon thing in the DevOps world, where work is brought into a shared chat room. You can run commands directly from chat and everyone in the chatroom can see the history of work being done, do the same, interact with each other and even learn. The information and process is owned by the entire team which brings a lot of benefits.</p>

<p>Recently we explained how to use <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/10/21/auto-remediation-stackstorm-splunk/"><strong>Syslog with Splunk &amp; StackStorm</strong></a> to auto-remediate a link going down on a switch. Splunk is a widely used log management tool but there’s also a popular open source alternative – <a href="https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack"><strong>Elastic Stack</strong></a> (formerly the ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana). So if you’re using the Elastic Stack, and are looking to automate event remediation in your environment, you’re at the right place! In this post, we’re taking the same <a href="https://stackstorm.com/2016/10/21/auto-remediation-stackstorm-splunk/">use case as before</a> and talking about how to set up the Elastic stack to collect syslog data and trigger event-based network remediation workflows using <strong>StackStorm</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.splunk.com"><strong>Splunk</strong></a> is a great tool for collecting and analyzing log data. StackStorm is a great tool for automated event-driven remediation. So what happens when we stick them together? Here’s how to use Splunk to collect syslog data and trigger event-based network remediation workflows using <strong>StackStorm</strong>!</p>

<p>We had a great afternoon with the <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd12">NFD</a> team as we walked them through our vision, design principles and demos of the Brocade Workflow Composer. We had productive discussions and got good, candid feedback. Caffeine and sugar kept everyone’s critical abilities to the max. There’s 4 separate video sessions…here’s what happened:</p>

<p>This blog post will take you through the <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-octopusdeploy">integration pack for OctopusDeploy</a> and give you some example actions and rules to integrate with other packs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-octopusdeploy">What is OctopusDeploy?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.octopusdeploy.com">Octopus Deploy</a> is an automated deployment tool for .NET and Windows environments. It has gained significant popularity amongst the .NET development community for it’s ease of use and integration into the Microsoft development ecosystem. OctopusDeploy enables users to automate deployment of applications, packages and tools to Windows environments.</p>
<h2 id="why-integrate-octopusdeploy-into-stackstorm">Why integrate OctopusDeploy into StackStorm?</h2>
<p>Octopus Deploy provides a rich system for Windows application deployments, but this is typically part of a wider DevOps process. Unlike StackStorm, it does not support closed-loop monitoring, remediation or infrastructure configuration and building, it does not integrate into configuration management tools (nor claim to). If you want to integrate OctopusDeploy from another tool, as part of a DevOps or environment tool you could</p>

<p>What do companies like eBay, VMware, Facebook, Netflix, Mirantis, Verizon, Infosys, Cisco, Dell, LinkedIn, and Apple have in common?</p>
<p>They all attended the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Auto-Remediation and Event-Driven Automation MeetUp<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Oct. 20th hosted by the StackStorm team at Brocade in San Jose.</p>
<p>The topic for the evening was “Remediation For Real” and both Mirantis and Netflix provided excellent overviews and demonstrations of how auto-remediation is helping to address business issues and increase their engineers’ productivity (and sleeptime!).</p>
