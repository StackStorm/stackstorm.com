The 2020 ChatOps User Survey is here! This is your chance to submit your feedback on using ChatOps with StackStorm – what we get right, what we get wrong, and what we need to focus on.
We will use this feedback to chart the development roadmap for ChatOps, whether that means leaving st2chatops as-is, or focusing on supporting more chat providers, deeper feature support for specific providers, improving ChatOps integration with the rest of StackStorm (RBAC for ChatOps!

<p>ChatOps has been a key part of StackStorm from the outset. Even before 1.0, our first public release, you could execute any action or workflow from your chat window and get a bunch of text in response. Like this:</p>
<p><img src=http://i.imgur.com/aJCOKC9.png alt><br>
<em>StackStorm 1.0, September 2015</em></p>
<p>Last September (even less than a year ago, to think about it) ChatOps as a defined collaboration model was still relatively new, and the ability to execute a StackStorm action or workflow from chat was enough to excite early adopters. You could make basic workflows and routine actions work, and it made your job a little easier while keeping your teammates in the loop. However, when you wanted to read and share the output, a dumped Python object as a response wasn’t ideal.</p>

The Brief History of ChatOps at StackStorm (and How We Got Here)
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
<p><strong>February 25, 2016</strong><br>
<em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p>These days ChatOps has become all the rage. In this blog I’ll talk a little bit about how we came to be here – in a leading position when it comes to ChatOps adoption for operations. And I’ll point you to some resources from users and our own engineers to learn more.</p>
<p>The history lesson will be brief, I promise.</p>
<p>We started StackStorm after observing that existing solutions in the devops universe were generally point solutions, often evolved from scripts and other projects that DevOps engineers wrote to make their own lives easier. And that’s a great way to build a solution that appeals at least to those types of users for those specific use cases.</p>
<p>What we saw was that while there were leaders within certain segments amongst those tools, there was no clearly adopted pattern for the wiring that tied all these tools together. Moreover, with our backgrounds in enterprises we knew that wiring together extremely heterogeneous environments is always a challenge. The enterprise is more a brownfield than a greenfield.</p>
<p>A quick shout out to teams at Facebook and at WebEx Spark and all those other early interviewees that taught us so much about event driven automation. And if you want to join a non commercial Bay Area meet-up about the subject and hear speakers from organizations like Facebook and LinkedIn and Netflix, please join here:<br>

<em>by Jon Middleton, Optimisation Project Lead @ Pulsant Limited</em></p>
<p>In the post StackStorm QuickTip: ChatOps your pack dev workflow James Fryman gave a ChatOPS alias recipe to reduce the friction for deploying packs and then in the <em>Random Thoughts</em> section asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This action is tied directly to the <code>packs.install</code>. What about a workflow? Seems like that would be a better way to structure this.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonated with me as I had already started working on an internal pack that did just that, as I thought attempting to deploy a pack via an alias (and action) contained within the same pack would be madness (or just lead to interesting race conditions). In the last week, our <em>Pull Request</em> has been merged, documentation has been included in st2docs (<a href=https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/chatops/pack_deploy.html>link</a>) for a workflow that fulfils the above random thought and should be released with 1.4.</p>
<p>So introducing <code>packs.deploy</code>, an action written in Mistral to handle the mapping of names for Git repositories to the information required to carry out the <code>packs.install</code> action.</p>

Stackstorm: from Nagios integration to Openstack automation
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
<p><strong>January 07, 2016</strong><br>
<em>by Igor Cherkaev aka eMptywee</em></p>
<p>Recently I’ve been playing around Stackstorm – a platform for integration and automation of day-to-day tasks, monitoring events, existing scripts and deployment tools.</p>
<p>I am going to explain how easy it is to wrap your daily tasks into Stackstorm actions and workflows and how to provide a simple way of execution for complex tasks.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking for a while and initially I was going to bring everything up in one blog post. But later, it didn’t seem like a good idea. That being said, I’d rather break it into multiple posts, no matter how many there would be. Anyway, it seems to me that it’d be more practical and easier to read and understand.</p>
<h2 id=nagios>Nagios</h2>
<p>Let’s start with integrating Nagios alerts into Stackstorm. Assuming that you already have Stackstorm version 1.2.0+ installed, configured and running, as well as there’s Nagios running somewhere else that is capable of processing alerts and handling events. If not, please, proceed to &lt;www.stackstorm.com> and &lt;www.nagios.org> (installation and initial configuration of these two tools is beyond the scope of this post). Both tools are open source and free to use and have extensive documentation on installation and basic configuration.</p>
<p>First of all, I was happy to find an existing Nagios integration pack <a href=https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-nagios>on StackStorm community repo</a>, but my joy ended really quickly as I found it not working. Secondly, <a href=https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/05/auto-remediation-out-of-disk-space/>this StackStorm tutorial</a> helped me to get started.</p>

<p><strong>December 8, 2015</strong><br>
<em>by Edward Medvedev</em></p>
<p>ChatOps — a concept where a chat bot acts as a control plane for your operations — has always been a core part of StackStorm. It adds context to your actions, automates routine tasks nobody likes, helps team members communicate better and learn from each other, and sometimes it’s just plain fun. If you’re new to this, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37LmuHToYjQ">DevOps Next Steps talk</a> by <a href=https://github.com/jfryman>James Fryman</a>, and if you’ve been writing Eggdrop scripts in IRC since you were five but never used it in your daily operations, you might also get inspired from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw">ChatOps at GitHub talk</a> by Jesse Newland.</p>
<p>Today, we’re all excited to introduce — as a part of our <a href=https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/releases/tag/v1.2.0>1.2.0 release</a> — a completely revamped ChatOps feature list. If you’re already using our Hubot integration to execute StackStorm actions from chat, stop doing whatever it is you’re doing and update! If not, it’s a good time to get started: ChatOps is the way of the future, now more than ever.</p>

<p>ChatOps brings the context of work you are already doing into the conversations you are already having. @jfryman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatOps is still a fresh and uncommon thing in the DevOps world, where work is brought into a shared chat room. You can run commands directly from chat and everyone in the chatroom can see the history of work being done, do the same, interact with each other and even learn. The information and process is owned by the entire team which brings a lot of benefits.</p>

<p>I’ve done a couple articles about getting StackStorm set up, an introductory video, and put a fair amount of effort towards minimizing the barrier to entry for new users.  Overall, I think StackStorm was successful in providing a quick and easy way to get our system up and running but users need more than that.  Users need to see how StackStorm can help solve their specific pain points.  We needed a way to illustrate that we can provide an easy to use solution without the steep learning curve of throwing out your existing tools.  Over a series of a few blog posts we are going to go over some of the ways that we have leveraged the StackStorm platform internally and how these solutions could map to your environment.</p>
