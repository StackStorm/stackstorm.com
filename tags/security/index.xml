In the last couple of weeks StackStorm has published back-to-back releases. 2.10.2 is a traditional patch release from StackStorm, and you’ll find some of the highlights below. 2.10.3 and 2.9.3; however, are releases to address CVE-2019-9580. I want to thank Barak Tawily and Anna Tsibulskaya: the researchers who discovered and submitted a patch for the issue.
The issue found by Barak and Anna is an improper handling of CORS headers.</description>
