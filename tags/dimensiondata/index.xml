&lt;p>At DevOps Enterprise Summit 2016, DevOps leaders like Target, American Airlines, Disney, and Quicken Loans spoke of the importance of managing/optimizing operations, addressing technical debt, eliminating silos, collaboration, and the importance of open source and community to drive innovation. I was especially struck by &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jason Cox of Disney&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who stressed the importance of “creating a culture of courage” where teams are encouraged to be curious, to experiment, explore and embrace change across process, roles, and technology-all for the purpose of enabling meaningful work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out that these themes are being talked about not only by these large Enterprise DevOps leaders. These themes are being repeated in conversations around the globe with IT leaders who are looking to leverage DevOps practices to successfully drive innovation and digital transformation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anthony Shaw, Group Director of Innovation and Technical Talent at &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dimension Data&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> has seen this first hand. Anthony not only leads innovation efforts within Dimension Data-but he also travels the world speaking with customers about their business priorities, their Digital Transformation goals, and how the innovative use of technology, organizational structure, community, and transforming day to day operational practices can accelerate their Digital Transformation journey.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
