<em>by Lindsay Hill</em></p>
<p><a href=https://www.perfsonar.net/>PerfSonar</a> is a super handy toolkit for measuring network performance between any two points. Combine this with the Guest VM built into the <a href=https://www.extremenetworks.com/product/slx-9850-router/>Extreme SLX series of switches,</a> and you can easily run performance tests between any two points on your network, measuring performance, latency, jitter, MTU, path taken, etc. Combine that with StackStorm, and you can easily run those tests from Slack. No need to even login to a switch.</p>
<h2 id=demo-network-performance-tests-via-slack>Demo: Network Performance Tests via Slack</h2>
<p>Check out the video here. From Slack, we can trigger different tests between any two switches – <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iperf>performance</a>, <a href=http://software.internet2.edu/owamp/>one-way latency measurement</a>, or <a href=https://linux.die.net/man/8/tracepath>trace the path</a>, showing the path MTU. The results are then shown in Slack:</p>

<p>Packet Captures are a necessary evil when you need to prove network innocence. But they’re tedious to configure, collect & analyze. What if you could simplify the setup, collection and viewing? That’s what we’ve done here, combining StackStorm, Extreme Insight Architecture, <a href=https://www.cloudshark.org>CloudShark</a>, and of course Slack.</p>

You might prefer to <a href=docs.stackstorm.com/packs.html>read the documentation</a> if that is not what you are into. Otherwise, grab a favorite caffeinated drink of your choice and let’s begin!</em></p>
<p>A little while ago we <a href=https://stackstorm.com/2016/12/06/2-1-new-pack-management/>rolled out StackStorm 2.1</a>, a release focused on one primary theme: integration packs.</p>
<p>StackStorm pack management infrastructure is evolving with the demand. As the number of integration packs grows, we want to provide means for faster and easier deployment, make pack development more productive, and encourage collaboration. There are dozens of changes making it happen—both in our internal infrastructure and the StackStorm core—and we are excited and hopeful that through better experience with integration packs, working with StackStorm will become even more efficient, easy, and fun.</p>
<p>As it is the case with all “thematic” releases, 2.1 is more than just a set of features and changes. It has a lot of context around it, and more importantly, it has a story—and this is a story we are now going to tell.</p>

<p>At DevOps Enterprise Summit 2016, DevOps leaders like Target, American Airlines, Disney, and Quicken Loans spoke of the importance of managing/optimizing operations, addressing technical debt, eliminating silos, collaboration, and the importance of open source and community to drive innovation. I was especially struck by Jason Cox of Disney, who stressed the importance of “creating a culture of courage” where teams are encouraged to be curious, to experiment, explore and embrace change across process, roles, and technology-all for the purpose of enabling meaningful work.</p>
<p>It turns out that these themes are being talked about not only by these large Enterprise DevOps leaders. These themes are being repeated in conversations around the globe with IT leaders who are looking to leverage DevOps practices to successfully drive innovation and digital transformation.</p>
<p>Anthony Shaw, Group Director of Innovation and Technical Talent at Dimension Data has seen this first hand. Anthony not only leads innovation efforts within Dimension Data-but he also travels the world speaking with customers about their business priorities, their Digital Transformation goals, and how the innovative use of technology, organizational structure, community, and transforming day to day operational practices can accelerate their Digital Transformation journey.</p>

<em>Nov 15, 2016</em></p>
<p>The DevOps movement is focused on leading transformational change and driving innovation. At the recent DevOps Enterprise Summit in San Francisco, many of the leaders in the field spoke of driving change through a culture focused on collaboration, community, co-creation, curiosity, continual learning, designing for joy, and meaningful work. I have been impressed with the passion and conviction that leaders in the DevOps movement speak about and emphasize these key principles.. Through determination and focus, living out these key values, and recognizing that everyone has a role to play—we will be able to truly unlock the power of technology to address the many complex global challenges we face today.</p>
<p>An excellent example of leveraging DevOps and technology to address complex global challenges is found in the field of Genomics Research. Through focus on the values spoken about by DevOps thought leaders and innovation at the speed of community—Science, Universities, Government, and Business, powered by advances in IT, are able to join forces to develop and evolve techniques that allow for the reading of the source code of biology—something that is incredibly complex and in parts extremely optimized. Through this important work, we are just beginning to unlock the secrets and miraculous mysteries to life on earth as we know it.</p>

When you stop by booth 1131, we will give you a token of our appreciation. It’s an NodeMCU microcontroller. It’s pretty cool – WiFi built in, ARM microcontroller, lots of GPIO pins, and it can easily be programmed using the freely-available Arduino IDE. It gets you into the world of IoT quickly and easily, and it’s a lot of fun! Bonus!</p>

The Brief History of ChatOps at StackStorm (and How We Got Here)

</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
<p><strong>February 25, 2016</strong><br>
<em>by Evan Powell</em></p>
<p>These days ChatOps has become all the rage. In this blog I’ll talk a little bit about how we came to be here – in a leading position when it comes to ChatOps adoption for operations. And I’ll point you to some resources from users and our own engineers to learn more.</p>
<p>The history lesson will be brief, I promise.</p>
<p>We started StackStorm after observing that existing solutions in the devops universe were generally point solutions, often evolved from scripts and other projects that DevOps engineers wrote to make their own lives easier. And that’s a great way to build a solution that appeals at least to those types of users for those specific use cases.</p>
<p>What we saw was that while there were leaders within certain segments amongst those tools, there was no clearly adopted pattern for the wiring that tied all these tools together. Moreover, with our backgrounds in enterprises we knew that wiring together extremely heterogeneous environments is always a challenge. The enterprise is more a brownfield than a greenfield.</p>
<p>A quick shout out to teams at Facebook and at WebEx Spark and all those other early interviewees that taught us so much about event driven automation.

<em>by Jon Middleton, Optimisation Project Lead @ Pulsant Limited</em></p>
<p>In the post StackStorm QuickTip: ChatOps your pack dev workflow James Fryman gave a ChatOPS alias recipe to reduce the friction for deploying packs and then in the <em>Random Thoughts</em> section asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This action is tied directly to the <code>packs.install</code>. What about a workflow? Seems like that would be a better way to structure this.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonated with me as I had already started working on an internal pack that did just that, as I thought attempting to deploy a pack via an alias (and action) contained within the same pack would be madness (or just lead to interesting race conditions). In the last week, our <em>Pull Request</em> has been merged, documentation has been included in st2docs (<a href=https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/chatops/pack_deploy.html>link</a>) for a workflow that fulfils the above random thought and should be released with 1.4.</p>
<p>So introducing <code>packs.deploy</code>, an action written in Mistral to handle the mapping of names for Git repositories to the information required to carry out the <code>packs.install</code> action.</p>

<p>This tutorial will show you how to leverage the power of the StackStorm API to expose your fantastic new workflows built using the Flow (available to Enterprise Edition uses) by <a href=https://stackstorm.com/2015/10/02/tutorial-of-the-week-cassandra-auto-remediation/>following one of the blogs</a>.</p>
<p>In our fictional scenario, we have built 2 complex workflows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Engage Tractor Beam, this workflow deploys some virtual machines to cloud, uses Hubot to notify the staff and then Puppet to drive the tractor beam.</li>
<li>Open/Close loading bay doors, this workflow takes the desired state of the doors to drive another workflow.</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to provide our technical operations team with a really simple UI where they can just click these buttons and we hide the magic behind the scenes.</p>
<h2 id=starting-off>Starting off</h2>
<p>First off, this is a tutorial for ASP.NET 4.5, MVC 5 and WebAPI 2.0, the latest Microsoft Web Development toolkit.</p>
<p>If you want to use another stack, you can follow the patterns here to repeat in another language.</p>
<p>Opening up Visual Studio (here I am using 2013, 2015 would also work), select the ASP.NET Web Application template</p>
<p>When prompted, pick out the Single Page Application option, this will install a whole smorgasbord of web-development tools.</p>

<em>Guest post by <a href=https://twitter.com/anthonypjshaw>Anthony Shaw</a>, Head of Innovation, ITaaS at <a href=http://dimensiondata.com>Dimension Data</a></em></p>
<p>This blog post will take you through the <a href=https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-octopusdeploy>integration pack for OctopusDeploy</a> and give you some example actions and rules to integrate with other packs.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-octopusdeploy>What is OctopusDeploy?</h2>
<p><a href=http://www.octopusdeploy.com>Octopus Deploy</a> is an automated deployment tool for .NET and Windows environments. It has gained significant popularity amongst the .NET development community for it’s ease of use and integration into the Microsoft development ecosystem. OctopusDeploy enables users to automate deployment of applications, packages and tools to Windows environments.</p>
<h2 id=why-integrate-octopusdeploy-into-stackstorm>Why integrate OctopusDeploy into StackStorm?</h2>
<p>Octopus Deploy provides a rich system for Windows application deployments, but this is typically part of a wider DevOps process. Unlike StackStorm, it does not support closed-loop monitoring, remediation or infrastructure configuration and building, it does not integrate into configuration management tools (nor claim to). If you want to integrate OctopusDeploy from another tool, as part of a DevOps or environment tool you could</p>
