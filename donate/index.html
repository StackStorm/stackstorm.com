<h4 id="what-are-the-project-expenses">What are the project Expenses?</h4>
<p>The StackStorm project relies on third party paid services, tools, and infrastructure. See <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackStorm Expenses<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We’re constantly reviewing that list and trying to optimize the costs with FOSS programs.</p>
<h4 id="who-decides-how-funds-are-spent">Who decides how funds are spent?</h4>
<p>The StackStorm TSC, the project community board, oversees the needs and collectively decides where to spend the funds. The current <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/blob/master/OWNERS.md">StackStorm Maintainers List</a> consists of 10 members from different organizations.</p>
